Mr. Attorney General for the United States.
Mr. W. Wickham Smith for appellants in No. 515. Mr. Charles Curie was on his brief.
Mr. Solicitor General for the United States.
Nos. 340 was argued December 17, 18, 19, 20, 1900; No. 515 was argued January 14, 15, 1901.
MR. JUSTICE BROWN, after making the above statement, delivered the opinion of the court.
As the sole question presented by the record in these cases was whether Porto Rico and the Hawaiian Islands were foreign countries within the meaning of the tariff laws, we must hold, *222 for the reasons stated in De Lima v. Bidwell, just decided, that the board of general appraisers had no jurisdiction of the cases.
The judgments of the Circuit Court are therefore reversed, and the cases remanded to that court with instructions to reverse the action of the board of general appraisers.
