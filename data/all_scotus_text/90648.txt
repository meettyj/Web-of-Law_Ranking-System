Attention is at once arrested by certain marked differences between the two specifications. The drawings are alike. In the original specification the plate E is described as a yielding plate, while in the reissue it is merely a plate. In the original it is said that the lower end of the plate E is connected to the step through a bar with an eye in it which engages with an aperture in a flange on the step. In the reissue it is said that the lower end of the plate E may be so connected. In the original *45 the plate E is described as being flexible. In the reissue the inventor says that he prefers to make it of flexible material. In the original it is said that the elasticity of the plate E enables it to hold the door firmly either closed or open. In the reissue it is said that such elasticity will produce that effect when the plate E is connected to the step as shown in the drawings. In the original the description is that, as the door is opened, the plate E turns on the pivot device at its lower end, which connects it to the step. This is omitted in the reissue. In the original the plate is said to act as a spring to hold the door either open or shut. This is omitted in the reissue. The object of these changes is apparent. Unless the plate E is connected at the bottom with the step, the door cannot be kept open or closed by the operation of elasticity in the plate, for no elasticity can be developed unless the plate is held at its bottom. In the original the holding of the plate at its bottom to the step is made the rule; in the reissue it is made the exception. In the original the plate is said to be flexible, and is not said to be ever other than flexible. In the reissue only a preference for flexibility is asserted. The object of these changes is to arrive at a claim for a plate not held at its bottom to the step. Accordingly, the reissue makes the statement, not found in the original, that the important feature of the invention is to have the plate attached to the door, and thus operate as a step-cover and a wheel-fender. The first claim of the reissue is not found in the original, and grows out of the changes above mentioned. It is a broad claim to a combination with the step and the door of the plate E attached to the door, to operate as a step-cover and a wheel-fender, substantially as and for the purpose specified. The second claim in the reissue is substantially the same as the single claim of the original. It combines the features of the attachment of the plate, at its bottom, to the step, and, at its top, to the door, and of elasticity in the plate to hold the door open or closed.
The defendant's apparatus is a piece of material rigidly attached at its top to the door, and not attached at its bottom to the step, and operating as a combined step-cover and wheel-fender. It is plain that this construction did not infringe the claim of the original patent. It is alleged that it infringes the *46 first claim of the reissue. The defendant obtained a patent, No. 90,584, May 25, 1869, for an "improvement in step-covers and wheel-fenders for carriages." It was granted more than four years before the plaintiff applied for his reissue. The defendant's apparatus is constructed substantially in accordance with the description in that patent. That apparatus has on the rear part of the door elastic guards, which come against the wheel when the door is open. The claim of the patent is to the combined arrangement.
It is shown by the evidence that prior to the plaintiff's invention a combined wheel-fender and step-cover was in use in several forms, the step-cover being attached by a vertical arm or vertical arms to the bottom of the door by a rigid connection, and swinging back by the opening of the door, the vertical arm or arms then serving as a wheel-fender. In those structures the step-cover was a horizontal plate, projecting from the lower end of the vertical arm, and overlapping and covering, when the door was shut, the horizontal step, and being parallel with it. The defendant's structure differs from these old forms solely in having the vertical arm, which is rigidly attached to the lower part of the door, so extended in width as to itself cover the step and permit the horizontal part of the step-cover to be dispensed with. There is no difference in principle or mode of operation between the old structures and the defendant's structure. The difference is merely in form and shape. The plaintiff departed, in his original patent, from the principle of the old structures by joining his step-cover to the step and having the vertical plate yielding and flexible, so that its elasticity may keep the door open or closed. This, so far as appears, was a new invention, and he was entitled to claim it. He did claim it, and the original patent was adequate to secure it to him. The first claim of the reissue, if construed so as to cover the defendant's structure, must equally cover the old structures referred to. They had combined a step and a door, and a plate attached to the door, the plate operating as a step-cover when the door was closed, and as a wheel-fender when the door was open. Extending the vertical arm in width, so as to dispense with the horizontal projection from it, and make the vertical arm wide enough to cover the *47 step, or contracting the vertical arm in width and putting on the lower end of it a horizontal piece parallel with the step and overlying it, involved no new principle of structure or operation.
There is no suggestion in the specification of the original patent that the plate E is to be used disconnected at its lower end from the step, or to be any other than a yielding plate, so arranged as to keep the door open and shut, in addition to acting as a step-cover and wheel-fender. The first claim of the reissue, if construed so as to cover the defendant's structure, is void for want of novelty, being anticipated by the old structures referred to. Moreover, if so construed, it is invalid as being for a different invention from any found in the original patent. And, if it is so limited as to be no broader than the claim of the original patent, there has been no infringement of it. Under any view, the decree of the court below was correct; and it is
Affirmed.
