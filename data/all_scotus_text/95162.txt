The parties in this case and in Wilcox v.

It is also stipulated by the parties to the two suits, by their *59 respective attorneys, that, unless this court otherwise ordered, only the record in the Wilcox suit should be printed, and that the appeal in this case might be heard and submitted without printing the record thereof.
Upon the authority of United States v. Oregon & California Railroad Company and Wilcox v. Eastern Oregon Land Company, just decided, the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals, reversing the judgment of the Circuit Court and directing a decree in favor of the plaintiff, the Eastern Oregon Land Company, is
Affirmed.
