Ed. 1123, is temporarily modified to permit the diversion to and including the 31st day of January 1957, from the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence System into the Illinois Waterway and the Mississippi River of such amount of water not exceeding an average of 8,500 cubic feet a second, in addition to domestic pumpage, as the Corps of Engineers, United States Army, shall determine will be useful in alleviating the emergency with respect to navigation currently existing without seriously interfering with navigation on the Illinois Waterway, at such times and in such amounts as the Corps of Engineers shall direct. The entry of this order shall not prejudice the legal rights of any of the parties to these causes with respect to any other diversion of the waters involved.
