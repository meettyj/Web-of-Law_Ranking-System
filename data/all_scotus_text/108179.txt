      '2. Whether the Ohio statute which provides that the trier of      fact shall determine both guilt and punishment in a single      verdict in cases of murder in the first degree violates      petitioner's right to be free from self-incrimination.     
    
      33       '3. Whether the Ohio statute which provides that the trier of      fact may grant or withhold a recommendation of mercy in cases      of murder in the first degree, and which provides no      standards or criteria to assist the trier of fact in making      such determination, violates petitioner's right to due      process and equal protection of the law.'
