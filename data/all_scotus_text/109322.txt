Jurisdiction is reserved by this Court to entertain such      further proceedings, including proceedings to determine the      coastline of any defendant State, to enter such orders, and      to issue such writs as may from time to time be deemed      necessary or advisable to give proper force and effect to      this decree. The United States or any defendant State may      invoke the jurisdiction so reserved by filing a motion in      this Court for supplemental proceedings.
