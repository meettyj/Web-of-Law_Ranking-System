This case, so far as any federal question is concerned, is similar, in all substantial respects, to that of Bell's Gap Railroad Co. v. Pennsylvania, just decided, and must be governed by the decision in that case.
The motion to dismiss the writ of error is denied, and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania is affirmed.
