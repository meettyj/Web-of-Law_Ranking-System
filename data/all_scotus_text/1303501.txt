2 U.S. 213 (____)
2 Dall. 213
SHOEMAKER, Assignee 
versus 
KEELY.
Supreme Court of United States.

The defendant's Counsel (Rawle), observed.
The plaintiff's Counsel (M. Levy) answered.
*214 BY THE COURT: â€” It is plain, that the action, in its present form, cannot be supported. Under the act of Assembly, nothing but debts are assigned, or assignable; and torts must be considered as the mere personal concern of the bankrupt.
Let Judgment be entered for the defendant.
