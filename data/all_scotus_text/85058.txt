12 U.S. 84
    8 Cranch 84
    3 L. Ed. 495
    GRACIE v. THE MARY'D. INS. COMP'Y.
    Feb. Term, 1814
    
      1
      This case differs from that against the Marine Insurance
    
    Company of Baltimore* only in one particular. A part of the cargo
    
      2
      remained on board the ship until the arrival of the French troops
    
    
      3
      when the departure of the vessel was prohibited by the general and
    
    
      4
      the ransom made.
    
    
      5
      This circumstance does not, in the opinion of the Court, vary
    
    
      6
      the case; because, omitting all other considerations, the loss, within the risk, being on only a part of the cargo, is a partial loss, and is affected by the warranty against particular average loss.
    
    
      7
      This judgment is also to be affirmed with costs.
