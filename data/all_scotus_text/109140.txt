      The District Court struck down the California statute providing state income-tax reductions for taxpayers sending their children to nonpublic schools. The Court summarily affirms this judgment. For the reasons stated in my dissent in Committee for Public Education & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U.S. 756, 813-824, 93 S. Ct. 2955, 37 L. Ed. 2d 948 (1973). I disagree and respectfully dissent.
