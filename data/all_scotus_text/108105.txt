      11
      The motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted. Upon consideration of the suggestion of the Solicitor General and upon examination of the entire record, the petition for a writ of certiorari is granted insofar as it seeks review of the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirming petitioner's conviction on Count 3 of the indictment charging a violation of 26 U.S.C. ยง 4704. The judgment of the Court of Appeals with respect to Count 3 is vacated and the case is remanded to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida with directions to dismiss Count 3 of the indictment. The petition for a writ of certiorari is otherwise denied.
