Opinion of the Court by MR. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND, announced by the CHIEF JUSTICE.
This is a companion case to No. 10, just decided. The facts, although differing in detail, are in substance the same. The same questions are involved.

Upon the authority of No. 10, ante, p. 84, the judgment below is
Affirmed.
