THE BATTLE.
Supreme Court of United States.

The appellant was not represented by counsel; Mr. N. Wilson, for the captors, and Mr. Ashton, special counsel, for the United States.
Mr. Justice NELSON delivered the opinion of the court.
The principle is too well settled that capture as prize of war, jure belli, overrides all previous liens, to require examination.[*]
DECREE AFFIRMED.
