112 U.S. 33 (1884)
SKIDMORE & Others 
v. 
PITTSBURG, CINCINNATI & ST. LOUIS RAILWAY COMPANY.
Supreme Court of United States.
Submitted October 17, 1884.
Decided October 27, 1884.
IN ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.
*34 Mr. George Willard and Mr. George Driggs for plaintiffs in error.
No counsel appeared for defendant in error.
*36 MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the court. He stated the facts in the foregoing language and continued:
The judgment below was clearly right. The Columbus, Chicago & Indiana Central Company was, in equity, the owner of the property when the lease was made and when the Pittsburg, Cincinnati & St. Louis Company went into possession under it. The deed executed in February, 1872, pursuant to the contract of purchase, converted the equitable title of the Columbus, Chicago & Indiana Central Company into a legal title, which at once, by operation of law, inured to the benefit of the Pittsburg, Cincinnati & St. Louis Company under its lease. All the rights of William B. Skidmore, as against the property, accrued long after those of the Pittsburg, Cincinnati & St. Louis Company and are subject to the title of that company. Such being the case, it is entirely unnecessary to inquire whether the Skidmores acquired a valid title to the property as against the Columbus, Chicago & Indiana Central Company. The Pittsburg, Cincinnati & St. Louis Company is entitled to the possession, whether that title be good or bad.
The judgment is affirmed.
