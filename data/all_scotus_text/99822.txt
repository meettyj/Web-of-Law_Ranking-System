256 U.S. 483     41 S. Ct. 579     65 L. Ed. 1054     CULPEPPER v. OCHELTREE.     No. 292.     Supreme Court of the United States     Argued April 26 and 27, 1921.     June 1, 1921            Mr. Samuel Herrick, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.
      Mr. Patrick H. Loughran, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.
      Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.                 11       This case is in all material respects like McLaren v. Fleischer, 256 U.S. 477, 41 Sup. Ct. 577, 65 L. Ed. ——. It was decided in the same way by the state courts and was argued with that case here. Therefore the opinion in that will suffice to dispose of this.
