8 Cranch 417
THE UNITED STATES 
v. 
THE BRIGANTINE MARS.
Supreme Court of United States.
March 15, 1814.
JOHNSON, J. delivered the opinion of the Court as follows:
"This case depends upon the principle established in the case against the coffee, the Bohlens, Claimants.[*]
*418 The decision, as in that case, was founded upon the ground of a sale to a bona fide purchaser without notice.
The decree of the Circuit Court of Massachusetts district, in this case is therefore reversed, and the Brigantine Mars adjudged forfeited to the United States."
