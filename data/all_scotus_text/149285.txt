       See United States v. Detroit Timber & Lumber Co., 200 U.S. 321, 337.   SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES                                         Syllabus                   BLACK ET AL. v. UNITED STATES  CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR                 THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT      No. 08–876.      Argued December 8, 2009—Decided June 24, 2010 Petitioners (hereinafter Defendants)—executives of Hollinger Interna   tional, Inc. (Hollinger), a publicly held U. S. company—were indicted   for mail fraud, 18 U. S. C. §§1341, 1346, and other federal crimes. At   trial, the Government pursued alternative mail-fraud theories, charg   ing that (1) Defendants stole millions from Hollinger by fraudulently   paying themselves bogus “noncompetition fees”; and (2) by failing to   disclose those fees, Defendants deprived Hollinger of their honest   services. Before jury deliberations began, the Government proposed   special-verdict forms that would reveal, in the event that the jury   voted to convict on a mail-fraud count, the particular theory or theo   ries accounting for the verdict. Defendants resisted, preferring an   unelaborated general verdict. The Government ultimately acqui   esced. The District Court instructed the jury on each of the alterna   tive theories. As to honest-services fraud, the court informed the   jury, over Defendants’ timely objection, that a person commits that   offense if he misuses his position for private gain for himself and/or a   co-schemer and knowingly and intentionally breaches his duty of loy   alty. The jury returned general verdicts of “guilty” on the mail-fraud   counts, found that one Defendant was also guilty of obstruction of   justice, and acquitted Defendants on all other charges.
     On appeal, Defendants urged the invalidity of the honest-services   fraud jury instructions. Seeking reversal of their mail-fraud convic   tions, Defendants relied on Yates v. United States, 354 U.S. 298, 312,   which held that a general verdict may be set aside “where the verdict   is supportable on one ground, but not on another, and it is impossible   to tell which ground the jury selected.” The Seventh Circuit found no   infirmity in the honest-services instructions, but further determined   that even if those instructions were wrong, Defendants could not pre  2                      BLACK v. UNITED STATES                                   Syllabus      vail. By opposing the Government-proposed special-verdict forms,     the Court of Appeals declared, defendants had forfeited their objec     tion to the instructions. Their challenge would have become moot,     the court observed, had the jury received special-verdict forms sepa     rating the alternative fraud theories, and reported on the forms that     Defendants were not guilty of honest-services fraud. Defendants, the     Court of Appeals therefore reasoned, bore responsibility for the ob     scurity of the jury’s verdict. Held:     1. In Skilling v. United States, decided today, ante, p. __, this Court  vacated a conviction on the ground that the honest-services compo  nent of the federal mail-fraud statute, §1346, criminalizes only  schemes to defraud that involve bribes or kickbacks. That holding  renders the honest-services instructions given in this case incorrect.  P. 5.     2. By properly objecting to the honest-services jury instructions at  trial, Defendants secured their right to challenge those instructions  on appeal. They did not forfeit that right by declining to acquiesce in  the Government-proposed special-verdict forms. The Federal Rules  of Criminal Procedure do not provide for submission of special ques  tions to the jury. In contrast, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 49 pro  vides for jury interrogatories of two kinds: special verdicts, Rule  49(a); and general verdicts with answers to written questions, Rule  49(b). While the Criminal Rules are silent on special verdicts, they  are informative on objections to instructions. Criminal Rule 30(d)  provides that a “party who objects to any portion of the instructions  or to a failure to give a requested instruction must inform the court of  the specific objection and the grounds for the objection before the jury  retires to deliberate.” Defendants here, it is undisputed, complied  with that requirement. The Seventh Circuit, in essence, added a fur  ther requirement for preservation of a meaningful objection to jury  instructions. It devised a forfeiture sanction unmoored to any federal  statute or criminal rule. And it placed in the prosecutor’s hands au  thority to trigger the sanction simply by requesting a special verdict.  To boot, the appeals court applied the sanction to Defendants, al  though they lacked any notice that forfeiture would attend their re  sistance to the Government’s special-verdict request. Criminal Rule  57(b) is designed to ward off such judicial invention. It provides: “No  sanction . . . may be imposed for noncompliance with any require  ment not in federal law [or] federal rules . . . unless the alleged viola  tor was furnished with actual notice of the requirement before the  noncompliance.” Pp. 5–8.     3.

                                   No. 08–876                                    _________________   CONRAD M. BLACK, JOHN A. BOULTBEE, AND MARK    S. KIPNIS, PETITIONERS v. UNITED STATES  ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF             APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT                                   [June 24, 2010]       JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.    In Skilling v. United States, decided today, ante, p. __, we vacated a conviction because the indictment rested, in part, on an improper construction of the “honest services” component of the federal ban on mail fraud, 18 U. S. C. §§1341, 1346. A similar infirmity is present in this case. Here, too, the Government and trial court advanced an interpretation of §1346 rejected by the Court’s opinion in Skilling. Nevertheless, the Government urges, the convic tions of the defendants below, petitioners here, should be affirmed for an independent reason. At trial, the Govern ment pursued alternative theories: (1) money-or-property fraud; and (2) honest-services fraud. To pinpoint whether the jury based its verdict on money-or-property fraud, or honest-services fraud, or both, the Government proposed special interrogatories to accompany the verdict. The defendants resisted, preferring an unelaborated general verdict, and the Government ultimately acquiesced in that standard form of submission.    The Court of Appeals held that the defendants, by op posing the Government-suggested special interrogatories,  2                    BLACK v. UNITED STATES                            Opinion of the Court  forfeited their objection to the honest-services-fraud in structions given to the jury. 530 F.3d 596, 603 (CA7 2008). We reverse that ruling. A criminal defendant, we hold, need not request special interrogatories, nor need he acquiesce in the Government’s request for discrete find ings by the jury, in order to preserve in full a timely raised objection to jury instructions on an alternative theory of guilt.
                              I    Petitioners Conrad Black, John Boultbee, and Mark Kipnis, as well as Peter Atkinson,1 (collectively, Defen dants) were leading executives of Hollinger International, Inc. (Hollinger), a publicly held U. S. company that, through subsidiaries, owned newspapers here and abroad. In 2005, the Government indicted Defendants on multiple counts, of prime concern here, three counts of mail fraud in violation of §§1341 and 1346.2 Two theories were pur sued by the Government on each mail-fraud count. The Government charged that (1) Defendants stole millions from Hollinger by fraudulently paying themselves bogus “noncompetition fees”; and that (2) by failing to disclose their receipt of those fees, Defendants deprived Hollinger of their honest services as managers of the company. App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a–54a.    At the close of the four-month trial, the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois instructed the jury, discretely, on the theft-of-money-or-property and ——————    1 Peter Atkinson is a respondent in support of petitioners who quali  fies for relief under this Court’s Rule 12.6. See Letter from Michael S. Schachter to the Clerk of Court (July 29, 2009).    2 Section 1341 criminalizes use of the mails to further “any scheme or  artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises.” Section 1346 defines the §1341 term “scheme or artifice to defraud” to include “a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.”

Id., at 235a. As to the latter, the District Court informed the jury, over Defendants’ objection, that a person commits honest-services fraud if he “misuse[s] his position for private gain for himself and/or a co-schemer” and “knowingly and intentionally breache[s] his duty of loyalty.” Id., at 235a–236a.   Before jury deliberations began, the Government asked the District Court to employ a special-verdict form, which would reveal, in the event that the jury voted to convict on a mail-fraud count, the theory or theories accounting for the verdict—money-or-property fraud, honest-services fraud, or both. See App. 430a.3 Defendants opposed the Government-proposed special interrogatories and urged, instead, standard general-verdict forms. Id., at 432a. Comprehending, however, that in the event of a guilty verdict, “the jury’s specification of the [mail-]fraud theory might [aid] appellate review,” ibid., Defendants proposed an accommodation: Upon return of a guilty verdict on any mail-fraud count, jurors could be asked to specify the theory on which they relied, id., at 433a.   The Government objected to special interrogatories presented to the jury postverdict, App. to Pet. for Cert. 222a, and the District Court declined to adopt that proce dure, id., at 225a.4 When the court rejected postverdict ——————   3 The Government proposed this language for each defendant on each  mail-fraud count:   “If you find the defendant . . . Guilty with respect to [this Count], you must answer the following question by checking the applicable lines.   “With respect to [this Count], we, the jury, find the following has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt (check all that apply):   “Defendant engaged in a scheme to defraud [Hollinger] and its shareholders of money or property ____   “Defendant engaged in a scheme to defraud [Hollinger] and its shareholders of their intangible right to honest services ____.” App. 430a.   4 In her years at the bar and on the bench, the trial judge commented,  4                    BLACK v. UNITED STATES                           Opinion of the Court  interrogatories, the Government represented that it would not object to submission of the mail-fraud counts for jury decision by general verdict. Id., at 228a. The jury re turned general verdicts of “guilty” on the three mail-fraud counts;5 it also found defendant Black guilty of obstruction of justice in violation of 18 U. S. C. §1512(c)(1), and it acquitted Defendants on all other charges.   On appeal, Defendants urged the invalidity of the jury instructions on honest-services fraud. Under the rule declared by this Court in Yates v. United States, 354 U.S. 298, 312 (1957), a general verdict may be set aside “where the verdict is supportable on one ground, but not on an other, and it is impossible to tell which ground the jury selected.” Relying on that rule, Defendants urged reversal of their mail-fraud convictions. The Court of Appeals found no infirmity in the honest-services instructions, 530 F. 3d, at 600–602, but further determined that Defendants could not prevail even if those instructions were wrong, id., at 602–603. For this determination, the court homed in on the Government’s special-verdict proposal.   The challenge to the honest-services instructions would have become moot, the court observed, had the jury re ceived special-verdict forms separating money-or-property fraud from honest-services fraud, and reported on the forms that Defendants were not guilty of honest-services fraud. Defendants, the Court of Appeals reasoned, bore responsibility for the obscurity of the jury’s verdict. True, the court acknowledged, it was not incumbent on Defen dants to request special verdicts. But by resisting the Government’s proposal for separate findings on money-or property fraud and on honest-services fraud, and request  —————— she had “absolutely” never seen the postverdict procedure used. App. to Pet. for Cert. 225a.   5 The District Court later granted Kipnis’ motion for judgment of  acquittal on one of these counts.

S. ____ (2010)                       5                             Opinion of the Court  ing general verdicts instead, the Seventh Circuit con cluded, Defendants had “forfeited their objection to the [honest-services] instruction[s].” Id., at 603. Defendants’ suggestion of postverdict interrogatories did not, in the Court of Appeals’ view, overcome the forfeiture, for “[q]uestioning the jurors after they have handed down their verdict is not a good procedure and certainly not one that a district judge is required to employ.” Ibid.6    We granted certiorari in this case, 556 U. S. ___ (2009), along with Skilling v. United States, 558 U. S. ___ (2009), and Weyhrauch v. United States, 557 U. S. ___ (2009), to determine what conduct Congress rendered criminal by proscribing, in §1346, fraudulent deprivation of “the in tangible right of honest services.” We also agreed to con sider in this case the question whether Defendants for feited their objection to the honest-services jury instructions by opposing the Government’s request for special verdicts.
                                II   We decided in Skilling that §1346, properly confined, criminalizes only schemes to defraud that involve bribes or kickbacks. See ante, p. __. That holding renders the honest-services instructions given in this case incorrect,7 and brings squarely before us the question presented by the Seventh Circuit’s forfeiture ruling: Did Defendants, by failing to acquiesce in the Government’s request for spe cial verdicts, forfeit their objection, timely made at trial, to the honest-services instructions? ——————   6 See, e.g., Jacobs Mfg. Co. v. Sam Brown Co., 19 F.3d 1259, 1267 (CA8 1994) (“Postverdict interrogatories may imply the jury’s verdict is unjustified and cause the jury to answer the interrogatories in a man ner inconsistent with the verdict.”); cf. Yeager v. United States, 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 11) (“Courts properly avoid . . . explora tions into the jury’s sovereign space.”).    7 The scheme to defraud alleged here did not involve any bribes or  kickbacks.  6                     BLACK v. UNITED STATES                            Opinion of the Court     In addressing this issue, we note first the absence of any provision in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for submission of special questions to the jury. See Stein v. New York, 346 U.S. 156, 178 (1953) (“Our own Rules of Criminal Procedure make no provision for anything but a general verdict.”), overruled on other grounds, Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368 (1964).8 The sole call for special findings in the Criminal Rules concerns nonjury trials. Rule 23(c) provides: “If a party [in a case tried without a jury] requests before the finding of guilty or not guilty, the court must state its specific findings of fact in open court or in a written decision or opinion.”    In contrast, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide for jury interrogatories of two kinds: special verdicts, which instruct the jury to return “a special written finding on each issue of fact,” Rule 49(a); and general verdicts with answers to “written questions on one or more issues of fact,” Rule 49(b).9 Although not dispositive,10 the ab sence of a Criminal Rule authorizing special verdicts counsels caution.11 ——————     8 The absence of a special verdict or interrogatory provision in the Criminal Rules is hardly accidental. See Skidmore v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 167 F.2d 54, 70 (CA2 1948) (L. Hand, J., concurring) (“I should like to subject a verdict, as narrowly as was practical, to a review which should make it in fact, what we very elaborately pretend that it should be: a decision based upon law. In criminal prosecutions there may be, and in my judgment there are, other considerations which intervene to make such an attempt undesirable.”).    9 Although the special interrogatories requested by the Government  in this case have been called “special verdicts” by the parties and the courts below, they more closely resemble what Civil Rule 49(b) de scribes as “general verdict[s] with answers to written questions.” (Capitalization omitted.)    10 See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 57(b) (when there is no controlling law,  “[a] judge may regulate practice in any manner consistent with federal law, these rules, and the local rules of the district”).    11 By calling for caution, we do not mean to suggest that special ver  dicts in criminal cases are never appropriate. See United States v.                        Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                     7                            Opinion of the Court    While the Criminal Rules are silent on special verdicts, they are informative on objections to instructions. Rule 30(d) “clarifies what . . . counsel must do to preserve a claim of error regarding an instruction.” Advisory Com mittee’s Notes on 2002 Amendment on Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 30(d), 18 U. S. C. App., p. 915. The Rule provides: “A party who objects to any portion of the instructions or to a failure to give a requested instruction must inform the court of the specific objection and the grounds for the objection before the jury retires to deliberate.” Defendants here, it is undisputed, complied with that requirement.12   The Court of Appeals, in essence, added a further re quirement for preservation of a meaningful objection to jury instructions. It devised a forfeiture sanction un moored to any federal statute or criminal rule. And it placed in the prosecutor’s hands authority to trigger the sanction simply by requesting a special verdict. See 530 —————— Ruggiero, 726 F.2d 913, 922–923 (CA2 1984) (in complex Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act cases, “it can be extremely useful for a trial judge to request the jury to record their specific dispositions of the separate predicate acts charged, in addition to their verdict of guilty or innocence”); id., at 927 (Newman, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (“[A] District Court should have the discre tion to use a jury interrogatory in cases where risk of prejudice to the defendant is slight and the advantage of securing particularized fact finding is substantial.”).    12 The Government asserts that Defendants’ opposition to a special  verdict resulted in forfeiture not of their jury-instruction objection, but of their “Yates argument” that any instructional error may “requir[e] reversal.” Brief for United States 52, and n. 21 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Government thus appears to concede that Defen dants preserved their instructional challenge, but maintains that they are powerless to ask a court to assess the prejudicial effect of any error they may be able to demonstrate. See Reply Brief 29, n. 10 (on Gov ernment’s view, “[Defendants] could still ‘claim’ they were wrongly convicted, they just could not ask a court to do anything about it”). We see little merit in the Government’s attempt to divorce preservation of a claim from preservation of the right to redress should the claim succeed.  8                    BLACK v. UNITED STATES                           Opinion of the Court  F. 3d, at 603.13 To boot, the Court of Appeals applied the sanction to Defendants, although they lacked any notice that forfeiture would attend their resistance to the Gov ernment’s special-verdict request. There is a Rule de signed to ward off judicial invention of the kind present here. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 57(b) admon ishes: “No sanction or other disadvantage may be imposed for noncompliance with any requirement not in federal law [or] federal rules . . . unless the alleged violator was fur nished with actual notice of the requirement before the noncompliance.”   We hold, in short, that, by properly objecting to the honest-services jury instructions at trial, Defendants secured their right to challenge those instructions on appeal. They did not forfeit that right by declining to acquiesce in the Government-proposed special-verdict forms. Our decision in Skilling makes it plain that the honest-services instructions in this case were indeed incorrect. As in Skilling, ante, at 40–41, we express no opinion on the question whether the error was ultimately harmless, but leave that matter for consideration on remand.14                         *     *    *   For the reasons stated, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceed ings consistent with this opinion.
                                          It is so ordered.  ——————     13 Renderingthe Seventh Circuit’s forfeiture ruling all the more anomalous, at the time the trial court settled on the general verdict form, the Government was no longer pressing its special-verdict re quest. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 228a.   14 Black contends that spillover prejudice from evidence introduced on  the mail-fraud counts requires reversal of his obstruction-of-justice conviction. Brief for Petitioners 47–49. That question, too, is one on which we express no opinion.

I join the Court’s opinion with two exceptions. First, I do not join in its reliance, ante, at 7, on the Notes of the Advisory Committee in determining the meaning of Fed eral Rule of Criminal Procedure 30(d). The Committee’s view is not authoritative. See Krupski v. Costa Crociere S. p. A., 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1). The Court accurately quotes the text of the Rule, see ante, at 7, the meaning of which is obvious. No more should be said.   Second, I agree with the Court, ante, at 5, 8, that the District Court’s honest-services-fraud instructions to the jury were erroneous, but for a quite different reason. In my view, the error lay not in instructing inconsistently with the theory of honest-services fraud set forth in Skill ing v. United States, ante, p. ___, but in instructing the jury on honest-services fraud at all. For the reasons set forth in my opinion in that case, 18 U. S. C. §1346 is un constitutionally vague.
