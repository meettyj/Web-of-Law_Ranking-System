    Pringle v. Black's Executors
    Supreme Court of Pennsylvania
    April Term, 1787
    
      1
      Foreign attachment. A rule was obtained to shew cause why the foreign attachment should not be quashed: And the only question discussed on the argument was, whether a foreign attachment would lie against an executor? After hearing Counsel on both sides, and taking time to advise upon the subject, The Court were of opinion, that the foreign attachment ought to be quashed; and, accordingly, made
    
    The rule absolute.*
