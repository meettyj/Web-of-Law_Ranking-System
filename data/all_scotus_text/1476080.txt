106 U.S. 428 (____)
SCHOOL DISTRICT OF ACKLEY 
v. 
HALL.
Supreme Court of United States.

Mr. Walter H. Smith and Mr. Alexander T. Britton in support of the motions.
Mr. Galusha Parsons, contra.
*429 MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the court.
A failure to annex to or return with a writ of error an assignment of errors, as required by sect. 997 of the Revised Statutes, is no ground for dismissal for want of jurisdiction. If an assignment is filed in accordance with the requirements of par. 4, Rule 21, it will ordinarily be enough.
There is not in this case such a color of right to a dismissal as to make it proper for us to consider the motion to affirm. Whitney v. Cook, 99 U.S. 607.
Motions denied.
