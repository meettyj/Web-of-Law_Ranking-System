      The facts of this case are substantially the same as in No. 236 (Railway Co. v. Strum, 19 Sup. Ct. 979), except as to the amount involved, and the court in which the proceedings in attachment were commenced, and the judgment is reversed, and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
