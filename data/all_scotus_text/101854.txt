284 U.S. 576     52 S. Ct. 27     76 L. Ed. 500     George T. MITCHELL, Attorney General of the State of  Mississippi, et al., etc., appellants, v. PENNY STORES, Incorporated.     No. 5.     Supreme Court of the United States     October 26, 1931            PER CURIAM.                 11       In this suit, brought to enjoin the enforcement of the provisions of sections (2-c), 11, and 13 of article 1 of chapter 90 of the Laws of Mississippi of 1930, an application was made to the District Court of the United States for an interlocutory injunction. The District Court, composed of three judges (U. S. C., title 28, ยง 380 (28 USCA ยง 380)), granted an interlocutory injunction upon the giving by the plaintiffs of a bond payable to the State of Mississippi in the sum of $5,000, conditioned as required by law, restraining the enforcement of the statutory provisions until the cause could be fully heard and determined. No opinion was rendered by the District Court, and the only question presented by the record upon this appeal is whether the District Court abused its discretion in granting an injunction until the case could be heard upon the merits.

Jackson, 283 U.S. 527, 51 S. Ct. 540, 75 L. Ed. 1248, 73 A. L. R. 1464, and, as no abuse of discretion is shown, the order must be affirmed.
