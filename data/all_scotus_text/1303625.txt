2 Dall. 381
MAXWELL'S Lessee 
versus 
LEVY.
Supreme Court of United States.

After argument by M. Levy, for the plaintiff, and by W. Tilghman, for the defendant, IREDELL, Justice, delivered the opinion of the Court, in which the conveyance to the lessor of the plaintiff was considered as entirely colorable and collusive; and, therefore, incapable of laying a foundation for the jurisdiction of the Court.
The rule made absolute.
