    CITY OF CHESTER v. COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA.1
    March 10, 1890.
    
      BRADLEY, J.
    
    
      1
      This case, so far as any federal question is concerned, is similar, in all substantial respects, to that of Railroad Co. v. Com., ante, 533, (just decided,) and must be governed by the decision in that case. The motion to dismiss the writ of error is denied, and the judgment of the supreme court of Pennsylvania is affirmed.
