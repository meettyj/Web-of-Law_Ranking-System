This is a suit by many banks to prevent the Banking Board of Nebraska from carrying out and enforcing an act similar to the Oklahoma statute just passed upon.

The Circuit Court held the statute unconstitutional and issued an injunction against the enforcement of it. 172 Fed. Rep. 999. For the reasons given in the foregoing case the decree of the Circuit Court must be reversed.
Decree reversed.
