IN EQUITY.
*566 Decree adjudicating proprietary claims to land in the bed of Red River, in accordance with the opinion reported in 258 U.S. 574.
Certain issues in this cause involving proprietary claims to the bed of Red River having been heretofore submitted on the pleadings, various petitions of intervention and the evidence taken before and reported by a commissioner, and the court having considered those issues and announced its conclusions thereon in an opinion delivered May 1, 1922:
It is considered, ordered and decreed as follows:
1. That Red River is not a navigable stream in any part of its course within the State of Oklahoma.
2. That the State of Oklahoma did not in virtue of her admission into the Union as a State acquire any title to, or become the owner of, the bed of the part of Red River within her borders.
3. That the State of Oklahoma has no title, right or interest in or to the part of the bed of Red River within her borders, save such as is incidental to her ownership of lands on the northerly bank of the river.
4. That the intervener D.D. Brunson, who claims rights in the bed of Red River in virtue of certain oil and gas leases granted by the State of Oklahoma and her officers, did not acquire and does not hold any right whatever in such river bed under those leases or any of them, and that the said leases have been at all times void and of no force or effect.
*567 5. That the portion of the bed of Red River which formerly was within what was known and designated as Kiowa, Comanche and Apache Pasture Reserve Number One (commonly called the Big Pasture), and the portion of the bed of Red River which lies south of what formerly was known and designated as such pasture reserve, has not at any time been subject to location or acquisition under the mining laws of the United States.
6. That the several interveners hereafter named in this paragraph, who are asserting rights in the portions of the bed of Red River named in the last preceding paragraph in virtue of mining locations claimed to have been made under the mining laws of the United States, did not acquire and do not hold any right whatever in such river bed under those mining locations or any of them, and that the said mining locations have been at all times void and of no force or effect.
