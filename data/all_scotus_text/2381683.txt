ROSS 
versus 
CLARKE.
Supreme Court of United States.

*355 BY THE COURT. â€” The money is to be considered in the same state, as if it had been paid into the hands of the Sheriff. If a proceeding of this kind were allowed, there could be no end to suits. We are unanimously of opinion, that the foreign attachment has issued irregularly and ought to be quashed.
The rule made absolute.
