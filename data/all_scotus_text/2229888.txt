3 U.S. 371 (____)
3 Dall. 371
HAMILTON 
versus 
MOORE.
Supreme Court of United States.

*374 Ingersoll and Dallas, for the Defendant in error.
*377 But, THE COURT observed, that there was no error in point of fact; nor any clerical error to amend. The writ bears the date when it was actually sued out and lodged in the office: there is, therefore, nothing on the record, by which it can be amended; and the objection is fatal.
The Writ of Error was, therefore, non-prossed.
