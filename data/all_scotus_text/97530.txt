*585 SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES.

OCTOBER TERM, 1911.

ORDER.
It is ordered that the Rules of this Court[1] be amended as follows, viz:

Rule 6.[1]
Strike out Section 2, and insert the following:
2. Forty-five minutes on each side shall be allowed to the argument of a motion, and no more, without special leave of the Court, granted before the argument begins.
Strike out Section 5, and insert the following:
5. The Court in any pending cause will receive a motion to affirm on the ground that it is manifest that the writ or appeal was taken for delay only, or that the questions on which the decision of the cause depend are so frivolous as not to need further argument. The same procedure shall apply to and control such motions as are provided for in cases of motions to dismiss under paragraph 4 of this rule. Although the Court upon consideration of a motion to affirm may refuse to grant the motion, it may nevertheless, if the conclusion is arrived at that the case is of such a character as not to justify extended argument, order the cause transferred for hearing to a summary docket. The hearing of the causes on such docket will be expedited, the Court providing from time to time for such speedy disposition of the docket as the regular order of business may permit, and on the hearing *586 of such causes one-half hour will be allowed each side for oral argument.
NOTES
[1]  These rules are superseded by the rules promulgated December 22, 1911. See Appendix, post, to this volume.

Rule 22.M1
Strike out Section 3, and insert the following:
3. One and one-half hours on each side will be allowed for the argument, and no more, without special leave of the Court, granted before the argument begins. But in cases certified from the Circuit Courts of Appeals, cases involving solely the jurisdiction of the court below, and cases under the Act of March 2, 1907, 34 Stat. 1246, forty-five minutes only on each side will be allowed for the argument unless the time be extended. The time thus allowed may be apportioned between the counsel on the same side, at their discretion: Provided, always: That a fair opening of the case shall be made by the party having the opening and closing arguments.
(Promulgated October 23, 1911.)
