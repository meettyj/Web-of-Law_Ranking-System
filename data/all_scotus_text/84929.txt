YOUNG 
v. 
GRUNDY.
Supreme Court of United States.

E.J. Lee, for the appellant.
MARSHALL, Ch. J.
If the answer neither admits nor denies the allegations of the bill, they must be proved upon the final hearing. Upon a question of dissolution of an injunction they are to be taken to be true.
But the court has no doubt upon the question.
*52 No appeal or writ of error will lie to an interlocutory decree dissolving an injunction.
Writ of error dismissed with costs.
