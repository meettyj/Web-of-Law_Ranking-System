      No. 08–5274. Argued March 4, 2009—Decided April 29, 2009 An individual convicted for using or carrying a firearm during and in  relation to any violent or drug trafficking crime, or possessing a fire  arm in furtherance of such a crime, receives a 5-year mandatory  minimum sentence, in addition to the punishment for the underlying  crime. 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A)(i). The mandatory minimum in  creases to 7 years “if the firearm is brandished” and to 10 years “if  the firearm is discharged.” §§924(c)(1)(A)(ii), (iii).     Petitioner Dean was convicted of conspiring to commit a bank rob  bery and discharging a firearm during an armed robbery. Because  the firearm was “discharged” during the robbery, Dean was sen  tenced to a 10-year mandatory minimum prison term on the firearm  count. §924(c)(1)(A)(iii). On appeal, he contended that the discharge  was accidental, and that §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) requires proof that the de  fendant intended to discharge the firearm. The Eleventh Circuit af  firmed, holding that no proof of intent is required. Held: Section 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) requires no separate proof of intent. The  10-year mandatory minimum applies if a gun is discharged in the  course of a violent or drug trafficking crime, whether on purpose or  by accident. Pp. 2–9.     (a) Subsection (iii) provides a minimum 10-year sentence “if the  firearm is discharged.” It does not require that the discharge be done  knowingly or intentionally, or otherwise contain words of limitation.  This Court “ordinarily resist[s] reading words or elements into a  statute that do not appear on its face.” Bates v. United States, 522  U.S. 23, 29. Congress’s use of the passive voice further indicates  that subsection (iii) does not require proof of intent. Cf. Watson v.  United States, 552 U. S. ___, ___. The statute’s structure also sug  gests no such limitation. Congress expressly included an intent re  2                       DEAN v. UNITED STATES                                    Syllabus      quirement for the 7-year mandatory minimum for brandishing a fire     arm by separately defining “brandish” to require that the firearm be     displayed “in order to intimidate” another person. §924(c)(4). Con     gress did not, however, separately define “discharge” to include an in     tent requirement. It is generally presumed that Congress acts inten     tionally when including particular language in one section of a     statute but not in another. Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16,     23. Contrary to Dean’s contention, the phrase “during and in relation     to” in the opening paragraph of §924(c)(1)(A) does not modify “is dis     charged,” which appears in a separate subsection and in a different     voice than the principal paragraph. “[I]n relation to” is most natu     rally read to modify only the nearby verbs “uses” and “carries.” This     reading will not lead to the absurd results posited by Dean. Pp. 3–6.        (b) Dean argues that subsection (iii) must be limited to intentional     discharges in order to give effect to the statute’s progression of     harsher penalties for increasingly culpable conduct. While it is un     usual to impose criminal punishment for the consequences of purely     accidental conduct, it is not unusual to punish individuals for the un     intended consequences of their unlawful acts. The fact that the dis     charge may be accidental does not mean that the defendant is blame     less. The sentencing enhancement accounts for the risk of harm     resulting from the manner in which the crime is carried out, for     which the defendant is responsible. See Harris v. United States, 536     U.S. 545, 553. An individual bringing a loaded weapon to commit a     crime runs the risk that the gun will discharge accidentally. A gun     shot—whether accidental or intended—increases the risk that others     will be injured, that people will panic, or that violence will be used in     response. It also traumatizes bystanders, as it did here. Pp. 6–9.        (c) Because the statutory text and structure demonstrate that the     discharge provision does not contain an intent requirement, the rule     of lenity is not implicated in this case. 517 F.3d 1224, affirmed.     ROBERTS, C. J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which SCALIA, KENNEDY, SOUTER, THOMAS, GINSBURG, and ALITO, JJ., joined. STEVENS, J., and BREYER, J., filed dissenting opinions.

UNITED STATES  ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF             APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT                                   [April 29, 2009]      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.   Accidents happen. Sometimes they happen to individu als committing crimes with loaded guns. The question here is whether extra punishment Congress imposed for the discharge of a gun during certain crimes applies when the gun goes off accidentally.
                              I    Title 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A) criminalizes using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to any violent or drug trafficking crime, or possessing a firearm in further ance of such a crime. An individual convicted of that offense receives a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence, in addition to the punishment for the underlying crime. §924(c)(1)(A)(i). The mandatory minimum increases to 7 years “if the firearm is brandished” and to 10 years “if the firearm is discharged.” §§924(c)(1)(A)(ii), (iii).    In this case, a masked man entered a bank, waved a gun, and yelled at everyone to get down. He then walked behind the teller counter and started removing money from the teller stations. He grabbed bills with his left  2                   DEAN v. UNITED STATES                         Opinion of the Court  hand, holding the gun in his right. At one point, he reached over a teller to remove money from her drawer. As he was collecting the money, the gun discharged, leav ing a bullet hole in the partition between two stations. The robber cursed and dashed out of the bank. Witnesses later testified that he seemed surprised that the gun had gone off. No one was hurt. App. 16–19, 24, 27, 47–48, 79.    Police arrested Christopher Michael Dean and Ricardo Curtis Lopez for the crime. Both defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit a robbery affecting interstate commerce, in violation of 18 U. S. C. §1951(a), and aiding and abetting each other in using, carrying, possessing, and discharging a firearm during an armed robbery, in viola tion of §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) and §2. App. 11–12. At trial, Dean admitted that he had committed the robbery, id., at 76–81, and a jury found him guilty on both the robbery and firearm counts. The District Court sentenced Dean to a mandatory minimum term of 10 years in prison on the firearm count, because the firearm “discharged” during the robbery. §924(c)(1)(A)(iii); App. 136.    Dean appealed, contending that the discharge was accidental, and that the sentencing enhancement in §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) requires proof that the defendant in tended to discharge the firearm. The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that separate proof of intent was not required. 517 F.3d 1224, 1229 (CA11 2008). That deci sion created a conflict among the Circuits over whether the accidental discharge of a firearm during the specified crimes gives rise to the 10-year mandatory minimum. See United States v. Brown, 449 F.3d 154 (CADC 2006) (hold ing that it does not). We granted certiorari to resolve that conflict. 555 U. S. ____ (2008).
                               II     Section 924(c)(1)(A) provides:
      “[A]ny person who, during and in relation to any                   Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3                       Opinion of the Court      crime of violence or drug trafficking crime . . . uses or     carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such     crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the     punishment provided for such crime of violence or     drug trafficking crime—       “(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not     less than 5 years;       “(ii) if the firearm is brandished, be sentenced to a     term of imprisonment of not less than 7 years; and       “(iii) if the firearm is discharged, be sentenced to a     term of imprisonment of not less than 10 years.”    The principal paragraph defines a complete offense and the subsections “explain how defendants are to ‘be sen tenced.’ ” Harris v. United States, 536 U.S. 545, 552 (2002). Subsection (i) “sets a catchall minimum” sentence of not less than five years. Id., at 552–553. Subsections (ii) and (iii) increase the minimum penalty if the firearm “is brandished” or “is discharged.” See id., at 553. The parties disagree over whether §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) contains a requirement that the defendant intend to discharge the firearm. We hold that it does not.
                               A   “We start, as always, with the language of the statute.” Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 420, 431 (2000). The text of subsection (iii) provides that a defendant shall be sen tenced to a minimum of 10 years “if the firearm is dis charged.” It does not require that the discharge be done knowingly or intentionally, or otherwise contain words of limitation. As we explained in Bates v. United States, 522 U.S. 23 (1997), in declining to infer an “ ‘intent to de fraud’ ” requirement into a statute, “we ordinarily resist reading words or elements into a statute that do not ap pear on its face.” Id., at 29.   Congress’s use of the passive voice further indicates that subsection (iii) does not require proof of intent. The pas  4                 DEAN v. UNITED STATES                       Opinion of the Court  sive voice focuses on an event that occurs without respect to a specific actor, and therefore without respect to any actor’s intent or culpability. Cf. Watson v. United States, 552 U. S. ___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 7) (use of passive voice in statutory phrase “to be used” in 18 U. S. C. §924(d)(1) reflects “agnosticism . . . about who does the using”). It is whether something happened—not how or why it happened—that matters.    The structure of the statute also suggests that subsec tion (iii) is not limited to the intentional discharge of a firearm. Subsection (ii) provides a 7-year mandatory minimum sentence if the firearm “is brandished.” Con gress expressly included an intent requirement for that provision, by defining “brandish” to mean “to display all or part of the firearm, or otherwise make the presence of the firearm known to another person, in order to intimidate that person.” §924(c)(4) (emphasis added). The defendant must have intended to brandish the firearm, because the brandishing must have been done for a specific purpose. Congress did not, however, separately define “discharge” to include an intent requirement. “[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.” Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted).    Dean argues that the statute is not silent on the ques tion presented. Congress, he contends, included an intent element in the opening paragraph of §924(c)(1)(A), and that element extends to the sentencing enhancements. Section 924(c)(1)(A) criminalizes using or carrying a fire arm “during and in relation to” any violent or drug traf ficking crime. In Smith v. United States, 508 U.S. 223 (1993), we stated that the phrase “in relation to” means “that the firearm must have some purpose or effect with                   Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5                       Opinion of the Court  respect to the drug trafficking crime; its presence or in volvement cannot be the result of accident or coincidence.” Id., at 238. Dean argues that the adverbial phrase thus necessarily embodies an intent requirement, and that the phrase modifies all the verbs in the statute—not only use, carry, and possess, but also brandish and discharge. Such a reading requires that a perpetrator knowingly discharge the firearm for the enhancement to apply. If the discharge is accidental, Dean argues, it is not “in relation to” the underlying crime.    The most natural reading of the statute, however, is that “in relation to” modifies only the nearby verbs “uses” and “carries.” The next verb—“possesses”—is modified by its own adverbial clause, “in furtherance of.” The last two verbs—“is brandished” and “is discharged”—appear in separate subsections and are in a different voice than the verbs in the principal paragraph. There is no basis for reading “in relation to” to extend all the way down to modify “is discharged.” The better reading of the statute is that the adverbial phrases in the opening paragraph— “in relation to” and “in furtherance of”—modify their respective nearby verbs, and that neither phrase extends to the sentencing factors.    But, Dean argues, such a reading will lead to absurd results. The discharge provision on its face contains no temporal or causal limitations. In the absence of an intent requirement, the enhancement would apply “regardless of when the actions occur, or by whom or for what reason they are taken.” Brief for Petitioner 11–12. It would, for example, apply if the gun used during the crime were discharged “weeks (or years) before or after the crime.” Reply Brief for Petitioner 11.    We do not agree that implying an intent requirement is necessary to address such concerns. As the Government recognizes, sentencing factors such as the one here “often involve . . . special features of the manner in which a basic  6                 DEAN v. UNITED STATES                       Opinion of the Court  crime was carried out.” Brief for United States 29 (quot ing Harris, 536 U. S., at 553; internal quotation marks omitted). The basic crime here is using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a violent or drug traffick ing crime, or possessing a firearm in furtherance of any such crime. Fanciful hypotheticals testing whether the discharge was a “special featur[e]” of how the “basic crime was carried out,” Harris, 536 U. S., at 553 (internal quota tion marks omitted), are best addressed in those terms, not by contorting and stretching the statutory language to imply an intent requirement.
                              B    Dean further argues that even if the statute is viewed as silent on the intent question, that silence compels a ruling in his favor. There is, he notes, a presumption that crimi nal prohibitions include a requirement that the Govern ment prove the defendant intended the conduct made criminal. In light of this presumption, we have “on a number of occasions read a state-of-mind component into an offense even when the statutory definition did not in terms so provide.” United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422, 437 (1978). “[S]ome indication of con gressional intent, express or implied, is required to dis pense with mens rea as an element of a crime.” Staples v. United States, 511 U.S. 600, 606 (1994).    Dean argues that the presumption is especially strong in this case, given the structure and purpose of the stat ute. In his view, the three subsections are intended to provide harsher penalties for increasingly culpable con duct: a 5-year minimum for using, carrying, or possessing a firearm; a 7-year minimum for brandishing a firearm; and a 10-year minimum for discharging a firearm. Incor porating an intent requirement into the discharge provi sion is necessary to give effect to that progression, because an accidental discharge is less culpable than intentional                   Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            7                       Opinion of the Court  brandishment. See Brown, 449 F. 3d, at 156.    It is unusual to impose criminal punishment for the consequences of purely accidental conduct. But it is not unusual to punish individuals for the unintended conse quences of their unlawful acts. See 2 W. LaFave, Sub stantive Criminal Law §14.4, pp. 436–437 (2d ed. 2003). The felony-murder rule is a familiar example: If a defen dant commits an unintended homicide while committing another felony, the defendant can be convicted of murder. See 18 U. S. C. §1111. The Sentencing Guidelines reflect the same principle. See United States Sentencing Com mission, Guidelines Manual §2A2.2(b)(3) (Nov. 2008) (USSG) (increasing offense level for aggravated assault according to the seriousness of the injury); §2D2.3 (in creasing offense level for operating or directing the opera tion of a common carrier under the influence of alcohol or drugs if death or serious bodily injury results).    Blackstone expressed the idea in the following terms:     “[I]f any accidental mischief happens to follow from     the performance of a lawful act, the party stands ex     cused from all guilt: but if a man be doing any thing     unlawful, and a consequence ensues which he did not     foresee or intend, as the death of a man or the like, his     want of foresight shall be no excuse; for, being guilty     of one offence, in doing antecedently what is in itself     unlawful, he is criminally guilty of whatever conse     quence may follow the first misbehaviour.” 4 W.     Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England     26–27 (1769). Here the defendant is already guilty of unlawful conduct twice over: a violent or drug trafficking offense and the use, carrying, or possession of a firearm in the course of that offense. That unlawful conduct was not an accident. See Smith, 508 U. S., at 238.   The fact that the actual discharge of a gun covered  8                 DEAN v. UNITED STATES                       Opinion of the Court  under §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) may be accidental does not mean that the defendant is blameless. The sentencing en hancement in subsection (iii) accounts for the risk of harm resulting from the manner in which the crime is carried out, for which the defendant is responsible. See Harris, supra, at 553. An individual who brings a loaded weapon to commit a crime runs the risk that the gun will dis charge accidentally. A gunshot in such circumstances— whether accidental or intended—increases the risk that others will be injured, that people will panic, or that vio lence (with its own danger to those nearby) will be used in response. Those criminals wishing to avoid the penalty for an inadvertent discharge can lock or unload the firearm, handle it with care during the underlying violent or drug trafficking crime, leave the gun at home, or—best yet— avoid committing the felony in the first place.    JUSTICE STEVENS contends that the statute should be read to require a showing of intent because harm resulting from a discharge may be punishable under other provi sions, such as the Sentencing Guidelines (but only if “bod ily injury” results). Post, at 6 (dissenting opinion) (citing USSG §2B3.1(b)(3)). But Congress in §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) elected to impose a mandatory term, without regard to more generally applicable sentencing provisions. Punish ment available under such provisions therefore does not suggest that the statute at issue here is limited to inten tional discharges.    And although the point is not relevant under the correct reading of the statute, it is wrong to assert that the gun shot here “caused no harm.” Post, at 1. By pure luck, no one was killed or wounded. But the gunshot plainly added to the trauma experienced by those held during the armed robbery. See, e.g., App. 22 (the gunshot “shook us all”); ibid. (“Melissa in the lobby popped up and said, ‘oh, my God, has he shot Nora?’ ”).

                              C    Dean finally argues that any doubts about the proper interpretation of the statute should be resolved in his favor under the rule of lenity. See Brief for Petitioner 6. “The simple existence of some statutory ambiguity, how ever, is not sufficient to warrant application of that rule, for most statutes are ambiguous to some degree.” Mus carello v. United States, 524 U.S. 125, 138 (1998); see also Smith, supra, at 239 (“The mere possibility of articulating a narrower construction, however, does not by itself make the rule of lenity applicable”). “To invoke the rule, we must conclude that there is a grievous ambiguity or uncer tainty in the statute.” Muscarello, supra, at 138–139 (internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, the statutory text and structure convince us that the dis charge provision does not contain an intent requirement. Dean’s contrary arguments are not enough to render the statute grievously ambiguous.                        *      *    *   Section 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) requires no separate proof of intent. The 10-year mandatory minimum applies if a gun is discharged in the course of a violent or drug traffick- ing crime, whether on purpose or by accident. The judg ment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is affirmed.
                                           It is so ordered.

UNITED STATES  ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF             APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT                          [April 29, 2009]       JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.    Accidents happen, but they seldom give rise to crimi nal liability. Indeed, if they cause no harm they seldom give rise to any liability. The Court today nevertheless holds that petitioner is subject to a mandatory additional sentence—a species of criminal liability—for an accident that caused no harm. For two reasons, 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) should not be so construed. First, the structure of §924(c)(1)(A) suggests that Congress intended to provide escalating sentences for increasingly culpable conduct and that the discharge provision therefore applies only to intentional discharges. Second, even if the statute did not affirmatively support that inference, the common law presumption that provisions imposing criminal penal ties require proof of mens rea would lead to the same conclusion. Cf. United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U.S. 64, 70 (1994). Accordingly, I would hold that the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that petitioner could be sentenced under §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) absent evidence that he intended to discharge his gun.
                              I   It is clear from the structure and history of §924(c)(1)(A) that Congress intended §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) to apply only to intentional discharges. The statute’s structure supports  2                     DEAN v. UNITED STATES                           STEVENS, J., dissenting  the inference that Congress intended to impose increas ingly harsh punishment for increasingly culpable conduct. The lesser enhancements for carrying or brandishing provided by clauses (i) and (ii) clearly require proof of intent. Clause (i) imposes a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence for using or carrying a firearm “during and in relation to” a crime of violence or drug trafficking offense, or possessing a firearm “in furtherance” of such an offense. As we have said before, the provision’s relational terms convey that it does not reach inadvertent conduct. See Smith v. United States, 508 U.S. 223, 238 (1993) (“The phrase ‘in relation to’ . . . at a minimum, clarifies that the firearm must have some purpose or effect with respect to the drug trafficking crime; its presence or involvement cannot be the result of accident or coincidence”). Simi larly, clause (ii) mandates an enhanced penalty for bran dishing a firearm only upon proof that a defendant had the specific intent to intimidate. See §924(c)(4). In that context, the most natural reading of clause (iii), which imposes the greatest mandatory penalty, is that it pro vides additional punishment for the more culpable act of intentional discharge.1    The legislative history also indicates that Congress intended to impose an enhanced penalty only for inten tional discharge. In Bailey v. United States, 516 U.S. 137, 148 (1995), the Court held that “use” of a firearm for purposes of §924(c)(1) required some type of “active em ployment,” such as “brandishing, displaying, bartering, striking with, and, most obviously, firing or attempting to fire.”    Congress responded to Bailey by amending ——————   1 Contrary to the Court’s suggestion, ante, at 4, Congress’ provision of  a specific intent element for brandishing and not for discharge only supports the conclusion that Congress did not intend enhancements under the discharge provision to require proof of specific intent; it supports no inference that Congress also intended to eliminate any general intent requirement and thereby make offenders strictly liable.

See Pub. L. 105–386, §1(2)(1), 112 Stat. 3469; see also 144 Cong. Rec. 26608 (1998) (remarks of Sen. DeWine) (refer ring to the amendments as the “Bailey Fix Act”). Given the close relationship between the Bailey decision and Congress’ enactment of the brandishing and discharge provisions, those terms are best read as codifying some of the more culpable among the “active employments” of a firearm that the Court identified in Bailey.
                             II    Even if there were no evidence that Congress intended §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) to apply only to intentional discharges, the presumption that criminal provisions include an intent requirement would lead me to the same conclusion. Con sistent with the common-law tradition, the requirement of mens rea has long been the rule of our criminal jurispru dence. See United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422 (1978). The concept of crime as a “concur rence of an evil-meaning mind with an evil-doing hand . . . took deep and early root in American soil.” Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 251–252 (1952). Legislating against that backdrop, States often omitted intent ele ments when codifying the criminal law, and “courts as sumed that the omission did not signify disapproval of the principle but merely recognized that intent was so inher ent in the idea of the offense that it required no statutory affirmation.” Id., at 252. Similarly, absent a clear state ment by Congress that it intended to create a strict liability offense, a mens rea requirement has generally been presumed in federal statutes. See id., at 273; Staples v. United States, 511 U.S. 600, 605–606 (1994). With only a few narrowly delineated exceptions for such crimes as statutory rape and public welfare offenses, the presump  4                  DEAN v. UNITED STATES                       STEVENS, J., dissenting  tion remains the rule today. See Morissette, 342 U. S., at 251–254, and n. 8; see also Staples, 511 U. S., at 606–607 (discussing United States v. Balint, 258 U.S. 250 (1922)).    Although mandatory minimum sentencing provisions are of too recent genesis to have any common-law pedi gree, see Harris v. United States, 536 U.S. 545, 579, 581, n. 5 (2002) (THOMAS, J., dissenting), there is no sensible reason for treating them differently from offense elements for purposes of the presumption of mens rea. Sentencing provisions of this type have substantially the same effect on a defendant’s liberty as aggravated offense provisions. Although a sentencing judge has discretion to issue sen tences under §924(c)(1)(A) within the substantial range bounded on one end by the 5-, 7-, or 10-year mandatory minimum sentence and on the other by the statutory maximum sentence, judges in practice rarely exercise that discretion. As JUSTICE THOMAS noted in Harris, “the sentence imposed when a defendant is found only to have ‘carried’ a firearm ‘in relation to’ a drug trafficking offense appears to be, almost uniformly, if not invariably, five years,” and “those found to have brandished a firearm typically, if not always, are sentenced only to 7 years in prison while those found to have discharged a firearm are sentenced only to 10 years.” Id., at 578 (dissenting opin ion); see also United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual §2K2.4, comment., n. 2 (Nov. 2008) (USSG) (stating that the minimum sentence required by §924(c)(1)(A) is the guideline sentence and any increase is an upward departure). If anything, imposition of a man datory minimum sentence under §924(c)(1)(A) will likely have a greater effect on a defendant’s liberty than will conviction for another offense because, unlike sentences for most federal offenses, sentences imposed pursuant to that section must be served consecutively to any other sentence. See §924(c)(1)(D)(ii).    As the foregoing shows, mandatory minimum sentenc                       Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                     5                           STEVENS, J., dissenting  ing provisions are in effect no different from aggravated offense provisions. The common-law tradition of requiring proof of mens rea to establish criminal culpability should thus apply equally to such sentencing factors. Absent a clear indication that Congress intended to create a strict- liability enhancement, courts should presume that a pro- vision that mandates enhanced criminal penalties re- quires proof of intent. This conclusion is bolstered by the fact that we have long applied the rule of lenity—which is similar to the mens rea rule in both origin and purpose—to provisions that increase criminal penalties as well as those that criminalize conduct. See United States v. R. L. C., 503 U.S. 291, 305 (1992) (plurality opinion); Bifulco v. United States, 447 U.S. 381, 387 (1980); Ladner v. United States, 358 U.S. 169, 178 (1958).2 Accordingly, I would apply the presumption in this case and avoid the strange result of imposing a substantially harsher penalty for an act caused not by an “evil-meaning mind” but by a clumsy hand.    The majority urges the result in this case is not unusual because legislatures commonly “punish individuals for the unintended consequences of their unlawful acts,” ante, at 7, but the collection of examples that follows this assertion ——————   2 To be sure, there are also inquiries for which the Court has said that sentencing provisions are different. In Harris v. United States, 536 U.S. 545, 557 (2002) (plurality opinion), and McMillan v. Pennsyl- vania, 477 U.S. 79, 87–88 (1986), the Court distinguished for purposes of constitutional analysis mandatory minimum sentencing schemes from offense elements and provisions that increase the statutory maximum sentence. I continue to agree with JUSTICE THOMAS’ compel- ling dissent in Harris, in which he rejected the distinction on the ground that mandatory minimum sentencing provisions have at least as significant an effect on a defendant’s liberty as additional convic- tions or statutory maximum provisions. 536 U. S., at 577–578. The logic of treating these provisions similarly is buttressed by our subse- quent decision in United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 233–234 (2005).  6                 DEAN v. UNITED STATES                      STEVENS, J., dissenting  is telling. The Court cites the felony-murder rule, 18 U. S. C. §1111, and Sentencing Guidelines provisions that permit increased punishment based on the seriousness of the harm caused by the predicate act, see USSG §2A2.2(b)(3) (increasing the offense level for aggravated assault according to the seriousness of the injury); §2D2.3 (increasing the offense level for operating a common car rier under the influence of alcohol or drugs if death or serious injury results). These examples have in common the provision of enhanced penalties for the infliction of some additional harm.         By contrast, §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) punishes discharges whether or not any harm is realized. Additionally, in each of the majority’s examples Congress or the Sentencing Commission made explicit its intent to punish the resulting harm regardless of the perpetrator’s mens rea. Section 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) contains no analogous statement. For these reasons, §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) is readily distinguishable from the provisions the majority cites.    Contrary to the majority’s suggestion, the existence of provisions that penalize the unintended consequences of felonious conduct underscores the reasonableness of read ing §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) to require proof of intent. When harm results from a firearm discharge during the commission of a violent felony or drug trafficking offense, the defendant will be punishable pursuant to USSG §2B3.1(b)(3) (in creasing the offense level for robbery according to the resulting degree of bodily injury), the felony-murder rule, or a similar provision. That a defendant will be subject to punishment for the harm resulting from a discharge whether or not he is also subject to the enhanced penalty imposed by §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) indicates that the latter provision was intended to serve a different purpose— namely, to punish the more culpable act of intentional discharge.

Were the statute unclear in that regard, I would reach the same conclusion by applying the pre sumption that Congress intended to include a mens rea requirement. Mandatory sentencing provisions are not meaningfully distinguishable from statutes defining crimes to which we have previously applied the presump tion; the rule of Morissette and Staples and not the felony murder rule should therefore guide our analysis. Because there is insufficient evidence to rebut the presumption in this case, I respectfully dissent.

              v. UNITED STATES  ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF  
          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT 
                         [April 29, 2009]   
   JUSTICE BREYER, dissenting.
   For many of the reasons that JUSTICE STEVENS sets forth, I believe the statutory provision before us applies to intentional, but not to accidental, discharges of firearms. As JUSTICE STEVENS points out, this Court in Bailey v. United States, 516 U.S. 137, 148 (1995), held that simple possession of a firearm, without some type of “active em ployment,” such as “brandishing, displaying, bartering, striking with, and, most obviously, firing or attempting to fire,” did not constitute “use” of a firearm. See ante, at 2 (dissenting opinion). It seems possible, if not likely, that Congress, in this statute, amended then-existing law by criminalizing the “simple possession” that Bailey found insufficient and then imposed a set of ever more severe mandatory sentences for the conduct that the Court listed in Bailey when it considered ways in which an offender might use a firearm. See ante, at 2–3. If so, the statutory words “is discharged,” 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A)(iii), refer to what Bailey called “firing,” and they do not encompass an accidental discharge.
   I concede that the Court lists strong arguments to the contrary. But, in my view, the “rule of lenity” tips the balance against the majority’s position. The “rule of len ity” as ordinarily applied reflects the law’s insistence that a criminal statute provide “fair warning . . . of what the  2                 DEAN v. UNITED STATES 
                     BREYER, J., dissenting  law intends to do if a certain line is passed.” United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 348 (1971) (internal quotation marks omitted). But here, where a mandatory minimum sentence is at issue, its application reflects an additional consideration, namely, that its application will likely produce an interpretation that hews more closely to Con gress’ sentencing intent.
   That is because, in the case of a mandatory minimum, an interpretation that errs on the side of exclusion (an interpretive error on the side of leniency) still permits the sentencing judge to impose a sentence similar to, perhaps close to, the statutory sentence even if that sentence (be cause of the court’s interpretation of the statute) is not legislatively required. See, e.g., United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual §2B3.1(b)(2) (Nov. 2008) (Specific Offense Characteristics) (possibly calling for a 7 to-9 year increase in the sentencing range in a case like this one). The sentencing judge is most likely to give a low non-Guidelines sentence in an unusual case—where the nature of the accident, for example, makes clear that the offender was not responsible and perhaps that the dis charge put no one at risk. See, e.g., Koon v. United States, 518 U.S. 81, 92–94 (1996). And, of course, the unusual nature of such a case means it is the kind of case that Congress did not have in mind when it enacted the stat ute. Moreover, an error that excludes (erroneously) a set of instances Congress meant to include (such as accidental discharge) could lead the Sentencing Commission to focus on those cases and exercise its investigative and judg mental powers to decide how those cases should be han dled. This investigation would, in turn, make available to Congress a body of evidence and analysis that will help it reconsider the statute if it wishes to do so.
   On the other hand, an interpretation that errs on the side of inclusion requires imposing 10 years of additional imprisonment on individuals whom Congress would not

                   BREYER, J., dissenting  have intended to punish so harshly. Such an interpreta tion would prevent a sentencing court from giving a lower sentence even in an unusual case, for example, where the accident is unintended, unforeseeable, and imposes no additional risk. And such an interpretation, by errone ously taking discretion away from the sentencing judge, would ensure results that depart dramatically from those Congress would have intended. Cf. Harris v. United States, 536 U.S. 545, 570 (2002) (BREYER, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (“statutory manda tory minimums generally deny the judge the legal power to depart downward, no matter how unusual the special circumstances that call for leniency”). Moreover, because such unusual cases are (by definition) rare, these errors would provide little incentive to the Sentencing Commis sion or Congress to reconsider the statute.
   These interpretive asymmetries give the rule of lenity special force in the context of mandatory minimum provi sions. Because I believe the discharge provision here is sufficiently ambiguous to warrant the application of that rule, I respectfully dissent.  e>
