400 U.S. 1207     91 S. Ct. 7     27 L. Ed. 2d 29     DEXTER et al. v. SCHRUNK et al.     No. _____.     Supreme Court of the United States     August 29, 1970            Application for a restraining order.
      Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, Circuit Justice.

      Under Dombrowski Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 85 S. Ct. 1116, 14 L. Ed. 2d 22, applicants make out a strong case for federal protection of their First Amendment rights. But Dombrowski, a five-to-two decision decided in 1965, is up for reexamination in cases set for reargument this fall. If the present case were before the Conference, I am confident it would be held pending the cases to be reargued. Hence, as Circuit Justice, I do not feel warranted in taking action contrary to what I feel the Conference would do. Accordingly, I deny the restraining order requested.
