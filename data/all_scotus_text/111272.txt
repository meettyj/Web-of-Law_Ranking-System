      11
      Adhering to our views that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 231, 96 S. Ct. 2909, 2950, 2973, 49 L. Ed. 2d 859 (1976), we would grant the application for stay of execution, grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case.
