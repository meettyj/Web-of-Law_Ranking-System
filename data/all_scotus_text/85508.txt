24 U.S. 429 (____)
11 Wheat. 429
CHACE and Others, Appellants, 
against 
VASQUEZ, the Consul General of Portugal, Respondent.
Supreme Court of United States.

*430 Mr. D. Hoffman, for the respondent.
The COURT were of opinion, that the case was embraced by the principle decided in the case of the Palmyra, since an appeal would still lie from the damages when ascertained; but, that, had the decree of the Circuit Court dismissed the libel, such decree would have been final.
Appeal dismissed.
