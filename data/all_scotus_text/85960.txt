January Term, 1836            11       BILL in equity from the district court of Louisiana, brought by appeal to this court, from a decree of the district court dimissing the bill upon a demurrer.          
      22
      It was suggested by Mr. Porter, as counsel for appellee, that Linton was dead, and he was ready to enter his appearance for his executor, and to revive the suit; and as no person appeared to prosecute the suit for the appellants, he moved for a dismissal of the appeal.     
    
      33
      The Court took the motion into consideration, and on the succeeding day directed the appeal to be dismissed.
