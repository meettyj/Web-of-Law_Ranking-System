      STATEMENT BY MR. JUSTICE HARLAN.     
    
      33       March 3, 1879. An act was passed by congress to prevent the introduction of contagious diseases into the United States, and establishing the national board of health, to consist of seven members, to be appointed by the president, by and with the advice and consent of the senate, 'whose compensation, during the time when actually engaged in the performance of their duties under this act, shall be ten dollars per diem each, and reasonable expenses;' four members of the board to be detailed from the army, navy, marine hospital service, and the department of justice, respectively, and to receive no compensation. The sum of $50,000 was appropriated 'to pay the salaries and expenses' of the board, and 'to carry out the purposes' of the act. 20 St. p. 484, c. 202.

      April 5, 1879. The appellant, Dunwoody, was appointed by the board its chief clerk, with compensation at the rate of $100 per month, dating from April 3, 1879.     
    
      55       June 2, 1879. Congress passed an act to prevent the introduction of contagious or infectious diseases into the United States, requiring the national board of health to co-operate with, and, so far as it lawfully might, aid, state and municipal boards of health to that end. The act appropriated $500,000, or so much thereof as might be necessary, to meet the expenses incurred in carrying out its provisions, and to be disbursed by the secretary of the treasury on estimates made by the national board of health, and approved by him. This act was to continue in force four years. 21 St. pp. 5, 7, c. 11.

      4040
      Dunwoody received no compensation from the United States either as chief clerk or disbursing agent after July 1, 1883, nor as member of the board from March 1, 1885, to and including June 30, 1885, or from May 12, 1886, to June 30, 1886.     
    
      4141       There was no meeting of the national board of health after November, 1884, but plaintiff went 'regularly to the office of the board, and attended to his duties as secretary.'          
      4242
      The appellant brought this action to recover from the United States $4,442.77, as compensation for his services as chief clerk and disbursing agent from July 1, 1883, to November 5, 1884; $1,710 for services as member of the board from March 1, 1885, to June 30, 1885, and from May 12, 1886, to June 30, 1886; and $2,090 for services as secretary of the board from November 5, 1884, to July 31, 1886; in all, $8,242.77.     
    
      4343       The United States, besides controverting the claims of the appellant, asked judgment, by way of counter-claim, for $11,391.21, which sum, it was alleged, he had illegally appropriated to his own used out of moneys set apart by congress for the expenses of the national board of health, and not intended by it to be used in payment of any salary or personal compensation.          
      4444
      The court of claims dismissed both the petition and counter-claim. 22 Ct. Cl. pp. 269, 277; 23 Ct. Cl. p. 82.

      4646
      Asst. Atty. Gen. Cotton, for the United States.     
    
      4747       Mr. Justice HARLAN, after stating the facts in the foregoing language, delivered the opinion of the court.          
      4848
      The United States has not appealed from the judgment below, and therefore we need not consider any question raised by its counter-claim.     
    
      4949       Does this case come within the principle announced in U. S. v. Langston, 118 U.S. 389, 394, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1185? Langston was minister resident and consul general of the United States at the republic of Hayti from September 28, 1877, until July 24, 1885, under a statute providing for a diplomatic representative of the United States to the republic of Hayti, at an annual salary of $7,500. That amount was annually appropriated for the salary of that officer from the creation of the office until 1883. But the diplomatic and consular appropriation acts for the fiscal years ending June 30, 1883, 1884, and 1885, appropriated only $5,000 for the minister of Hayti. And the question was whether Langston was entitled to $7,500 for each of the fiscal years last named. This court said: 'While the case is not free from difficulty, the court is of opinion that, according to the settled rules of interpretation, a statute fixing the annual salary of a public officer at a named sum, without limitation as to time, should not be deemed abrogated or suspended by subsequent enactments which merely appropriated a less amount for the services of that officer for particular fiscal years, and which contained no words that expressly, or by clear implication, modified or repealed the previous law.'          
      5050
      We do not think the present case comes within the principle of Langston's Case While the act of 1879, establishing the national board of health, may be said to have created the office of member of that board, with a fixed salary, and without express limitation as to time, the accompanying appropriation of a round sum to pay 'the salaries and expenses' of the board, and to 'carry out the purposes' of the act, indicates that congress intended that sum to be the limit of expenditure for such objects, unless further appropriations were made. But all doubt upon this subject is removed by subsequent legislation. The act of June 2, 1879, appropriating $500,000 to be disbursed on estimates to be furnished by the board to the secretary of the treasury, expired, by limitation, on the 2d of June, 1883; and that of July 1, 1879, required all money authorized by it to be expended, and all contracts and liabilities incurred by the board, to be paid out of the appropriation of $500,000. The appropriation of $75,000 by the act of June 16, 1880, was for salaries and expenses of the board, and to carry out the purposes of the various acts creating it. That made by the act of March 3, 1881, for 'salaries and expenses' of the board, was accompanied by a direction that no more money should be expended for the purposes of the various acts creating it, out of any appropriations previously made, or by virtue of any previous law; and the act of 1882 expressly provided that 'no other public money than that hereby appropriated shall be expended for the purposes of the board of health.' These enactments evince the purpose upon the part of congress not to create any liability upon the part of the United States in respect to the work of the national board of health, beyond the amounts specifially appropriated by it from time to time for that work. This purpose, if not clearly indicated by the act of 1879 establishing the board, became manifest before the plaintiff rendered the services for which, in this action, he claims compensation, as upon an implied contract. If the plaintiff is equitably entitled to be paid for any of the services in question rendered by him as a member of the board, and if the special appropriation made for the salaries and expenses of its officers and employes have been exhausted, his appeal must be made to congress. Looking at all the acts of congress passed before he became a member of the board, it is clear that he did not perform services as such member under any implied contract that he should be compensated otherwise than out of the moneys specially appropriated to meet the expenses incurred by the board in the performance of the duties imposed upon it. In other words, that board had no authority to incur any liability upon the part of the government for salaries or other expenses in excess of the amounts appropriated by congress for such purposes.     
    
      5151
      These views dispose of the case, adversely to the plaintiff, as to his claim for compensation as a member of the board. There is still less ground for a judgment in his favor in respect to services rendered as chief clerk, disbursing agent, and secretary. Congress never intended to incur liability for such services beyond the sums appropriated from time to time for the work of the board of health. Judgment affirmed.
