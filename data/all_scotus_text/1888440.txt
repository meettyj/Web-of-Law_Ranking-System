ST. LOUIS, IRON MOUNTAIN & SOUTHERN RAILWAY COMPANY 
v. 
EDWARDS.
No. 123.
Supreme Court of United States.
Submitted January 20, 1913.
Decided February 24, 1913.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS.
*266 Mr. Martin L. Clardy, Mr. H.G. Herbel, Mr. Lovick P. Miles and Mr. Thos. B. Pryor for plaintiff in error.
No appearance for defendant in error.
*267 MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the court.
This writ of error is prosecuted to secure the reversal of a judgment for seventy-five dollars, the amount of penalties imposed upon the plaintiff in error for delay in giving notice to the consignee, defendant in error, of the arrival of a carload of freight at the termination of an interstate commerce shipment. The exaction was authorized by ยง 3 of a law of the State of Arkansas, approved April 19, 1907 (Act 193, Acts of 1907, p. 453), entitled "An Act to regulate freight transportation of railroad companies doing business in the State of Arkansas." The section is copied in the margin.[1]
*268 The right to impose the penalty was challenged and the validity of the section of the statute authorizing it was assailed by demurrer on the ground of repugnancy to the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States. The question here for decision is whether the court below was right in overruling the Federal defense which was thus relied upon. 94 Arkansas, 394.
The Arkansas statute is styled in the opinion of the court below "the Demurrage Statute," and the penalty imposed by ยง 3 is referred to as a "demurrage charge." And in the same connection it is observed "There are other sections of the statute imposing demurrage charges on consignees for failure to remove freight, thus making the burdens of the whole statute reciprocal." It follows that the section under consideration was but intended to subject carriers to the penalties which the section provides because of a failure to make prompt delivery of freight on arrival at destination. As applied to interstate commerce, however, we think such penalties were not enforceable because of a want of power in the State to impose them in view of the legislation of Congress existing at the time the alleged duty to give notice arose. Recently in Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Co. v. Hardwick Farmers' Elevator Company, 226 U.S. 426, a regulation of the State of Minnesota enacted after the passage of the Hepburn Act imposing penalties on carriers for failing on demand to furnish a supply of cars for the movement of interstate traffic was held invalid because of the absence of power in a State in consequence of the Hepburn Act to provide for such penalties. While the case before us concerns the power of a State over the delivery of cars in consummation of an interstate shipment, we nevertheless think that the Hardwick Case is controlling because the legislation of Congress as clearly excludes the right of a State to penalize for failure to deliver interstate freight at the termination of an interstate shipment as it was *269 found to prevent a State from penalizing for failure to furnish cars for the initiation of the movement of interstate traffic. This conclusion is necessary since the amendment to ยง 1 of the Act to Regulate Commerce by which a definition is given to the term transportation and which in the Hardwick Case was held to exclude the right of a State to penalize for the non-delivery of cars to initiate the movement of an interstate shipment, by its very terms embraces the obligation of a carrier to deliver to the consignee, and therefore by the same token excludes the right of a State to penalize on that subject. The provision of the Hepburn Act in question is copied in the margin.[1a]
We are referred in argument to no other provision of the act tending in the slightest degree to indicate that the duties which were united by the provisions of one section of the act were divorced by another and were made therefore subject to the possibility of varying and it may be conflicting state penalties. On the contrary, in this instance as in the one considered in the Hardwick Case, the context of the act adds strength to the conviction produced by the definition of the first section, and therefore gives rise to the conviction that the context of the statute, not only as was held in the Hardwick Case, excludes the right of a State to regulate by penalties or demurrage charges the obligation of furnishing the means of interstate transportation, but also excludes power in a State to impose penalties as a means of compelling the performance *270 of the duty to promptly deliver in consummation of such transportation.
The judgment of the Supreme Court of Arkansas is reversed with costs, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
Reversed.
