PER CURIAM.
The judgment is affirmed. Rex Trailer Co. v. United States, 350 U.S. 148 (1956).
MR. JUSTICE STEWART, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER join, dissenting.
I do not agree that disposition of this case is controlled by the decision in Rex Trailer Co. v. United States, 350 U.S. 148. Believing that § 26 (b) (1) of the Surplus Property Act of 1944, 40 U. S. C. § 489 (b) (1), imposes a civil penalty, and that an action thereunder is therefore subject to the five-year limitation provided in 28 U. S. C. § 2462, I would reverse. Cf. United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, 317 U. S. 537; Erie Basin Metal Products, Inc., v. United States, 150 F. Supp. 561 (Ct. Cl.). See Priebe & Sons v. United States, 332 U. S. 407.
