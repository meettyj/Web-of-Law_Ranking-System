4 U.S. 22 (____)
4 Dall. 22
Rutherford et al. Plaintiffs in Error, 
versus 
Fisher et al.
Supreme Court of United States.

CHASE, Justice.
In England a writ of error may be brought upon an interlocutory decree or order; and until a decision is obtained upon the writ, the proceedings in the Court below are stayed. But here the words of the act, which allow a writ of error, allow it only in the case of a final judgment.
By the COURT:
The writ must be quashed with costs.
