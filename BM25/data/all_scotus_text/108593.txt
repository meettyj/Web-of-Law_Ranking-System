    J. Brian GAFFNEY, appellant, v. Theodore R. CUMMINGS et al.
    No. 71-1476 (A-1248).
    Supreme Court of the United States                           June 12, 1972         Application for stay.         The application for stay of judgment of the United States  District Court for the District of Connecticut presented to Mr.  Justice MARSHALL and by him referred to the Court is granted.    djQ  Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting.         Appellant seeks to stay the judgment of a three-judge Federal  District Court which held unconstitutional Connecticut's plan for  apportioning its state legislature. 341 F.Supp. 139. The plan was  adopted in September 1971, and was only in the preliminary stages  of implementation when it was struck down as violative of the  Equal Protection Clause on March 30, 1972. An appeal from that  decision has been docketed in this Court. Gaffney v. Cummings, No.  71-1476.         Mr. Justice STEWART would deny the application.         We denied a motion for expedited consideration of that appeal  on May 22, 1972. 406 U.S. 942, 92 S. Ct. 2047, 32 L.Ed.2d 330.  Appellant promptly moved the lower court for a stay of its
    Page 903    March 30th decision, and when that stay was denied on May 26,  1972, appellant came here.         Earlier this Term, in another reapportionment case, Mr.  Justice Powell articulated the considerations involved in our  review of applications for a stay of lower court judgments:         'A lower court judgment, entered by a tribunal that was       closer to the facts . . ., is entitled to a presumption of       validity. Any party seeking a stay of that judgment bears the       burden of showing that the decision below was erroneous and       that the implementation of the judgment pending appeal will       lead to irreparable harm.' Graves v. Barnes, 405 U.S. 1201,       1203, 92 S. Ct. 752, 30 L.Ed.2d 769.         'Irreparable injury,' of course, inheres in any challenge to  legislative apportionment. If the court below erred, the Fall  election will be held under an improper order, one which will  doubtless affect the composition of the next state legislature.  But this type of 'irreparable injury' affects both sides equally,  for if the court below was correct, staying its order will cause  irreparable harm of precisely the same dimension.         There is 'irreparable injury' in a different sense if the  court's order striking down a state apportionment is handed down  so near the upcoming election that it is administratively  impractical to implement an orderly election. Here, there is no  serious claim that irreparable injury, in this sense, would result  if a stay is not granted. The court below found as fact that there  is ample time before the Fall election to implement the plan  submitted by the Special Master on May 26, 1972, or any proposed  substitute which the State or appellant might submit within a  reasonable time.1 In-
    
      1
      Page 904    deed, appellant concedes that the question of which plan can be  most easily implemented is a 'non-issue.'2         Thus, the issue determinative of the stay application is the  probable correctness of the decision below, and, in my view,  appellant has not met his burden 'of showing that the decision  below was erroneous.'         In Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 577, 84 S. Ct. 1362, 12  L. Ed. 2d 506, we said 'the Equal Protection Clause requires that a  State make an honest and good faith effort to construct districts,  in both houses of its legislature, as nearly of equal population  as is practicable.' Moreover, a State may not be heard to argue  that a population variance is justified because it is de minimus.  '[T]he 'as nearly as practicable' standard requires that the State  make a good faith effort to achieve precise mathematical equality.  . . . Unless population variances among . . . districts are shown  to have resulted despite such effort, the State must justify each  variance, no matter how small.' Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, 394 U.S.  526, 530-531, 89 S. Ct. 1225, 22 L.Ed.2d 519.3           A comparison of the population variances in this case with  those disapproved in Kirkpatrick, supra, is striking. In  Kirkpatrick, the average variation from the ideal district was  only 1.6%. Here, assembly districts in the State Plan exhibited an  average variation of 1.9%. In Kirkpatrick, the ratio of the  largest to the smallest district was only 1.06 to 1. Here, the  ratio of the largest to the smallest assembly district is 1.082
    
    
      2
      Page 905    to 1. In Kirkpatrick, 70% of the districts were within plus or  minus 1.88% of the ideal population figure. Here, only 51.65% of  the assembly districts are within 2.0% of the ideal. In  Kirkpatrick, the total variance4 was 5.97%. Here, the total  variance of the assembly redistricting is 7.83%.         It is true, of course that 'the extent to which equality may  practicably be achieved may differ from State to State. . . .,'  Kirkpatrick, supra, at 530, 84 S. Ct. 1362. Thus a State may be  able to justify certain variations. Here, however, only two  justifications are offered, and neither appear to have particular  merit.         It is primarily argued that the variations are justified by a  legitimate state interest in achieving 'a partisan balancing of  strength in each house.' The District Court explained the concept  as follows:         'The partisan balancing of strength in each house, termed by       interveningdefendant [appellant in this Court] a 'fair       political balance' and by plaintiffs [appellees herein]       'political gerrymandering' was obtained by so adjusting the       census areas utilized as building blocks into the structuring       of Senate and House districts that, on the basis of the vote       for all the Senate candidates of each party in the elections       of 1966, 1968 and 1970, whichever party carried the state       should carry a majority of Senate seats proportional to the       statewide party majority, and likewise in the House, based on       the party vote for all the House candidates of each party in       the same three elections.         'In one or more House and one or more Senate districts some       accommodation was also made in
    
    
      3
      Page 906         the interest of retaining in office a particular incumbent.'       341 F.Supp. 139.         This Court has never decided whether political gerrymandering  or 'fair political balance' is per se unconstitutional,  irrespective of population variances. See, e. g., Wells v.  Rockefeller, 394 U.S. 542, 544, 89 S. Ct. 1234, 22 L.Ed.2d 535. But  we have said, in no uncertain terms, that gerrymandering is not a  justification where population variances do result. In  Kirkpatrick, for example, we even rejected the State's attempt  to justify the population variances there present on the ground  that the variations were necessary to avoid gerrymandering.         '[A]n argument that deviations from equality are justified in       order to inhibit legislators from engaging in partisan       gerrymandering is no more than a variant of the argument,       already rejected, that considerations of practical politics       can justify population disparities.' 394 U.S., at 534, 89       S. Ct. 1225.         Thus, whether or not Connecticut may gerrymander its  legislature if population equality is preserved, it may not do so  when population disparities result.         An additional consideration urged to justify the  discrepancies is the State's interest in preserving town lines.  But any weight factor this would ordinarily have is rendered  insignificant by the fact that the State's own plan cuts across 47  towns to create assembly districts, and 23 towns to create senate  districts. See Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U.S. 124, 162 n. 42, 91  S. Ct. 1858, 29 L.Ed.2d 363.         Appellant has one final argument. Attempting to litigate the  merits of the Special Master's plan, he argues that implementation  of that plan would exceed the equity power of the federal court  under our recent decision in Sixty-Seventh Minnesota State Senate  v. Beens, 406 U.S. 187, 92 S. Ct. 1477, 32 L.Ed.2d 1. But the  merits of the Special Master's plan are not before this Court.  Indeed, in
    
    
      4
      Page 907    denying the stay below, the District Court obligated itself to  'set down for hearing with all reasonable dispatch the plan  submitted by the Special Master and any other plans submitted.'  Whatever appellant's objections to the Master's plan might be, he  should first air them in the District Court which stands ready to  hear them.         Additionally, even were the Special Master's plan at issue,  appellant's objections would not be well taken. This is not a case  in which the size of a state house is 'slashed' in half, as in  Minnesota State Senate, supra. Here, the District Court merely  reduced the size of Connecticut's house from 151 members to 144,  in order that the number of house district be an even multiple of  the 36 senate districts.5 A house of such size is expressly  contemplated by the Connecticut Constitution.6 The District  Court's action is simply a 'minor variation,' allowing senate and  house districts to be drawn with congruent boundaries, that is  well within the remedial powers of an equity court.7         I dissent from the Court's order granting this stay.

         The legislature has recently acted to remove whatever  procedural roadblocks there might be to implementation of the  Master's plan or any other which the court below might adopt.  Public Act 220, May 16, 1972. The District Court indicated that  the legislature will shortly submit a plan of its own for the  court's consideration. 341 F.Supp. 139.

         Appellant's Reply Memorandum, at 3. See also appellant's  Motion for Stay of Judgment, at 8.3 It is irrelevant to this comparison that Kirkpatrick  involved congressional rather than state legislative  redistricting. In either case, the burden is on the State to  demonstrate a valid justification for any population variance, no  matter how small.

         The 'total variance' in an apportionment plan is derived  by adding together the percentage variation from the ideal of the  two districts which are respectively the most over- and  under-populated.
      
      
        5
         Minor variations for this purpose were approved in the  Minnesota State Senate case. 406 U.S., at 187, 92 S. Ct. 1477, and  cases cited in n. 10.6 Art. III, § 4, of the Connecticut Constitution provides  that 'The house of representatives shall consist of not less than  one hundred twenty-five and not more than two hundred twenty-five  members. . . .'7.Appellant also objects to the extent to which the Master's  plan dishonors town boundaries. It is undisputed, however, that  town boundaries cannot be preserved intact in all cases under any  constitutional plan. The Master's plan, drawn with the  preservation of as many town lines as possible as an express  consideration (though a subordinate one to the goal of population  equality), cuts across only 60 towns in creating assembly  districts, and 30 towns in creating senate districts. These  figures compare favorably with those in the State's plan, ante, at  906.
