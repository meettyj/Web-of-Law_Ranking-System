4 U.S. 21 (____)
4 Dall. 21
Blair et al. Plaintiffs in Error, 
versus 
Miller et al.
Supreme Court of United States.

By the COURT:
The writ has become a nullity, because it was not returned at the proper term. It cannot, of course, be a legal instrument, to bring the record of the Circuit Court before us for revision.[(1)]
