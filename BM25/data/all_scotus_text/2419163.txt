8 U.S. 370 (____)
4 Cranch 370
MORGAN 
v. 
CALLENDER.
Supreme Court of United States.

This court was of opinion that an appeal lies from that court to this; but that in this case, the court below had not jurisdiction, because it did not appear that the parties were citizens of different states, nor aliens, &c. so as to give them a right to litigate in the courts of the United States.
