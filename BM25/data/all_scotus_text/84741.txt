4 U.S. 353     4 Dall. 353     1 L. Ed. 864     Hurst's Lessee v. Jones.     Circuit Court, Pennsylvania District.     May Term, 1801            11       A FORMER ejectment, between the same parties, for the same land, had been non pros'd; but the costs of suit remained unpaid.

      The defendant's counsel objected to the trial of the present ejectment, until the costs of the former were paid.     
    
      33       By the COURT.

      The objection is reasonable and just. The defendant cannot, under such circumstances, be compelled to proceed to a trial.     
    
      55       The cause continued.          
      66
      Rawle, for the plaintiff.
