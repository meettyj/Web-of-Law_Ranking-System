The SIERRA CLUB AND ITS ATLANTIC CHAPTER                                 v.                   FEDERAL POWER COMMISSION et al.                            No. 71-1221.                 Supreme Court of the United States                            June 19, 1972         On petitions for writ of certiorari to the United States  Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.         The motion to dispense with printing the FPC opinion in No.  71-1219 to conform with Rule 39 is granted. The petitions for  writs of certiorari are denied.    djQ  Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting.         These petitions should be granted to consider whether the  Federal Power Commission complied with its obligations under §§  101 and 102 of the National Environ-

      Page 927    mental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. §§ 4331 and 4332, in granting  a license to Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc., for  the construction of a pumped storage power project on Storm King  Mountain on the Hudson River.         Under § 101 of the Act federal agencies are instructed to  take environmental consequences into account in their  decisionmaking.1 That mandate was aimed partly at eliminating the  excuse which had often been offered by bureaucrats that their  statutory authority did not authorize consideration of such  factors in their policy decisions. See Udall v. Federal Power  Commission, 387 U.S. 428, 87 S. Ct. 1712, 18 L.Ed.2d 869.2 More  impor-

Calvert Cliffs' Coordinating Committee, Inc. v.  United States AEC, 146 U.S.App.D.C. 33, 449 F.2d 1109, 1112.         Section 1023 requires that administrators incorporate

      Page 929    certain procedures into their operating routines in order (1) to  increase the likelihood that environmental consequences of agency  action will not be unforeseen and (2) to insure that if a project  is approved, an environmentally acceptable alternative will be  chosen. Section 102(2)(C) requires a detailed statement in  connection with actions significantly affecting the quality of the  human environment, specifying the environmental impact of the  proposed action and alternatives. Section 102(2)(D) places bureaus  under an affirmative duty to study and develop alternatives where  there are unresolved conflicts concerning the alternative uses of  available resources.         This case poses issues under both sections. In 1964 Con Ed  proposed to the Commission that it be allowed to construct a  reservoir atop Storm King mountain along with a hydroelectric  generating plant to be driven by water falling from the reservoir.  During the daytime hours when energy demand is high the plant  would be operational, but during the evening hours when part of  Con Ed's existing facilities are normally idle, power from one of  its existing plants would be used to pump water from the Hudson  River to the reservoir. In 1965 the Commission approved the  project but the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in a suit  brought by conservationists and local residents set aside the  order and remanded for more detailed consideration of various  environmental aspects of the project. Scenic Hudson Preservation  Conference v. FPC, 354 F.2d 608 (CA2).

      Page 930         After more hearings had been completed but before the  Commission acted, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969  became effective. Although it has been conceded that the Act's  requirements were applicable in these proceedings, no further  hearings were held; and no environmental impact statement was  drafted. The Commission approved the project and attempted to  satisfy its procedural duties under § 102 by specifying certain  environmental impact forecasts in its final opinion.         The Court of Appeals affirmed over the dissent of Judge Oakes  who thought that the Commission had not discharged its obligations  under NEPA. The majority held that under § 101 the ultimate  balance of energy and environmental values was the responsibility  of the Commission and courts could upset only decisions not  supported by 'substantial evidence.' It also held, with respect to  the procedural requirements of § 102, that the Commission's  hearings, and consultation with other agencies satisfied the  command that a 'systematic, interdisciplinary approach' be  utilized.4 It also found that the Commission's final opinion which  contained its environmental findings would, under the  circumstances, suffice as an environmental impact statement. A  petition for rehearing en banc was denied by an equally divided  court with Judge Timbers dissenting in a short opinion which  expressed doubt as to the validity of the majority's reliance on  the 'substantial evidence' test.         I believe the Court of Appeals gave the Act too restrictive a  meaning. As to the Commission's duty to take environmental impacts  into account, Judge Oakes made a strong case for the view that the  Commission (a) misjudged the risk that project construction might  work irreparable injury to one of
    
    
      6
      Page 931    three vital water supply systems serving New York City; (b)  underestimated the extent of additional air pollution which would  be generated by nighttime burning of fossil fuels in New York City  in order to generate the power needed to pump the river water to  the reservoir; and (c) generally undervalued environmental  considerations while overvaluing engineering and economic  considerations. Although value judgments are inevitable and even  though the Commission's balancing of environmental costs with  other factors may be entitled to some deference, I share Judge  Timber's doubts that under § 101 the balance struck by an agency  unskilled in environmental matters should be reviewed only through  the lens of the 'substantial evidence' test. Cf. Citizens to  Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 413, 91 S. Ct. 814,  28 L. Ed. 2d 136 ('If the statutes are to have any meaning, the  Secretary cannot approve the destruction of parkland unless he  finds that alternative routes present unique problems.') (But see  Calvert Cliffs', 449 F.2d, at 1115.).         I also am not satisfied that the procedural obligations under  § 102 were honored. First, the Commission did not draft the impact  statement required by § 102(2)(C). Thus when the Commissioners  deliberated the fate of Storm King Mountain, they did not have  before them a coherent study addressed to the environmental  consequences of the project and alternatives to it. Another panel  of the Second Circuit has recently ruled that the impact statement  must be written before action is taken. Greene County Planning  Board v. FPC, 455 F.2d 412 (CA2). Administrators cannot attempt to  comply with the Act by calling their final opinion their impact  statement. True, here the hearings had been completed after the  Act became effective. Yet the Commission could have deferred  decision until its own § 102 statement was prepared.

      Page 932         Second, the Commission's final opinion suggests that its  consideration of environmental issues is required only when  private citizens bring such problems to the agency's attention.  For example, in many passages of its opinion the Commission states  that particular objections to the project had been rejected for  lack of evidence in the administrative record.5 This approach  symptomatic of the phenomenon of bureaucratic  'industry-mindedness'—wrongly assumed that a presumption of  validity supported the Con Ed proposal and that environmental  groups had a burden of proof to overcome.         Similarly, the Commission limited its inquiry primarily to  those program alternatives which had been submitted by the  conservationists opposing the Con Ed project. The agency did not  generate its own alternatives, although Congress charged each  federal agency to represent not only the public interest in  general but also under NEPA to pay particular attention to the  environmental ramifications of its actions. Whether or not  conservationists appear to register dissent, the Commission is  told in § 102(2)(D) to 'study, develop and
    
    
      8
      Page 933    describe appropriate alternatives to recommend courses of action.  . . .' The agency is directed to apply its own expertise and  imagination in exploring less drastic alternatives. And, one  alternative, which went completely overlooked by the Commission,  as Judge Oakes noted below, is not to build any project at all.  Whether that option is realistic we do not know. Informing the  public and Congress on that score is the function of the impact  statement. In short, the Act requires that bureaucrats not only to  listen to protests, but to avoid projects that have imprudent  environmental impacts. There is no burden of proof for the  objector to overcome.         Finally, the Commission's opinion is too imprecise to provide  any helpful insight for Congress, the Council on Environmental  Quality, or the public into what value judgments it made. We know  that the Commission rejected alternatives with less deleterious  environmental consequences on the ground that they were 'more'  costly and 'less' reliable. But we have no reasonably precise  notion of how much reliability and money were gained at the  expense of the destruction of Storm King Mountain. Whether or not  courts may review the Commission's ultimate balance of these  competing considerations, the fact remains that Congress and the  public are entitled to know those judgments. One function of the §  102 statement is certainly to make explicit the priorities of the  agencies. That purpose is not served where all that is basically  told is that the preferred alternative is cheaper and more  reliable, though involving adverse implications for the  surrounding ecology.         If this kind of impact statement is tolerated, then the  mandate of NEPA becomes only a ritual and like the peppercorn a  mere symbol that has no vital meaning. The decision below is, in  other words, the beginning of the demise of the mandate of NEPA.         I would grant these petitions.

         Section 101 of the National Environmental Policy Act, 42  U.S.C. § 4331, provides in pertinent part:          '(b) In order to carry out the policy set forth in this  chapter, it is the continuing responsibility of the Federal  Government to use all practicable means, consistent with other  essential considerations of national policy, to improve and  coordinate Federal plans, functions, programs, and resources to  the end that the Nation may——          '(1) fulfill the responsibilities of each generation as  trustee of the environment for succeeding generations;          '(2) assure for all Americans safe, healthful, productive,  and esthetically and culturally pleasing surroundings;          '(3) attain the widest range of beneficial uses of the  environment without degradation, risk to health or safety, or  other undesirable and unintended consequences;          '(4) preserve important historic, cultural, and natural  aspects of our national heritage, and maintain, wherever possible,  an environment which supports diversity and variety of individual  choice.'2.In that case we held that the grant of authority to this  Commission to alienate federal water resources does not turn  simply on whether the project will be beneficial to the licensee.  Nor is the test solely whether the region will be able to use the  additional power. We said 'The test is whether the project will be  in the public interest. And that determination can be made only  after an exploration of all issues relevant to the 'public  interest,' including . . . the public interest in preserving  reaches of wild rivers and wilderness areas, the preservation of  anadromous fish for commercial and recreational purposes, and the  protection of wildlife.' 387 U.S., at 450, 87 S. Ct. 1712.          The Commission's attitude in that case re-appeared in the  present case: 'Implicit in the reasoning of the Commission and the  Examiner is the assumption that this project must be built and  that it must be built now.' 387 U.S., at 448, 87 S. Ct. 1712.

         Section 102 of the National Environmental Policy Act, 42  U.S.C. § 4332, provides in pertinent part:          'The Congress authorizes and directs, that, to the fullest  extent possible: (1) the policies, regulations, and public laws of  the United States shall be interpreted and administered in  accordance with the policies set forth in this Act, and (2) all  agencies of the Federal Government shall——          '(C) include in every recommendation or report on proposals  for legislation and other major Federal actions significantly  affecting the quality of the human environment, a detailed  statement by the responsible official on          '(i) the environmental impact of the proposed action,          '(ii) any adverse environmental effects which cannot be  avoided should the proposal be implemented,          '(iii) alternatives to the proposed action,          '(iv) the relationship between local short-term uses of  man's environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term  productivity, and          '(v) any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of  resources which would be involved in the proposed action should it  be implemented.          'Prior to making any detailed statement, the responsible  Federal official shall consult with and obtain the comments of any  Federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or special expertise  with respect to any environmental impact involved. Copies of such  statement and the comments and views of the appropriate Federal,  State, and local agencies, which are authorized to develop and  enforce environmental standards, shall be made available to the  President, the Council on Environmental Quality and to the public  as provided by section 552 of title 5, United States Code, and  shall accompany the proposal through the existing agency review  processes;          '(D) study, develop, and describe appropriate alternatives  to recommended courses of action in any proposal which involves  unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of available  resources; . . .'
