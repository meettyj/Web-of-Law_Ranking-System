FLOWER 
v. 
DETROIT.
No. 203.
Supreme Court of United States.
Argued April 3, 1888.
Decided May 14, 1888.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MICHIGAN.
Mr. Edward J. Hill for appellants.
Mr. George L. Roberts for appellees.
MR. JUSTICE BLATCHFORD delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a suit in equity, brought in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Michigan, by James *564 Flower, Thomas Flower, and George Flower, against the City of Detroit, the Fire Commission of the City of Detroit, Benjamin Vernon, president thereof, and the Board of Water Commissioners of the City of Detroit, for the infringement of reissued letters patent No. 6990, granted March 14, 1876, on an application filed February 17, 1876, to Thomas R. Bailey, Jr., for an "improvement in hydrants," the original patent, No. 75,344, having been granted to said Bailey, March 10, 1868. Among the defences set up in the answer, it was alleged that new matter, not constituting any substantial part of the alleged invention upon which the original patent was granted, was introduced into the specification of the reissue, and that the reissue is not for the same invention as the original patent, and is void.
The specifications and claims of the original and of the reissue are here placed side by side in parallel columns, the parts in each which are not found in the other being in italic.

                                                    It will be observed that the
                                            casing C loosely rests upon the
                                            main B, or upon a branch projecting
                                            upward from the same.
                                            This casing extends upward,
                                            enveloping the main portion
                                            of the water-pipe A, at least
                                            that portion which is subterranean.
                                            Said casing extends
                                            upwards and fits loosely about
                                            the plug or hydrant at the portion
                                            A'. Above the upper terminus
                                            of the casing C is provided
                                            the bead a upon the



*568
                                            hydrant proper. Sufficient
                                            space is left between the bead a
                                            and the upper terminus of the
                                            casing C to permit of sufficient
                                            up-and-down play of the said
                                            casing C, for the purpose
                                            which will hereafter more
                                            fully appear. This distance
                                            between the bead and casing
                                            may be adjusted to any desired
                                            distance, thus lengthening or
                                            shortening it, by means of its
                                            screw attachment at its base.
                                              The main function of the
                                            casing C is to prevent derangement
                                            of parts during cold
                                            weather by the ground alternately
                                            freezing and thawing
                                            around the hydrant or plug.
                                            This process of freezing causes
                                            the surrounding earth, by its
                                            expansion, to lift or upheave,
                                            and thus be liable to derange
                                            the hydrant or plug. This upheaval
                                            or movement is received
                                            by the casing C, which, by its
                                            capability of sliding loosely up
                                            and down, will accommodate
                                            the upheaval of the earth above
                                            mentioned, without any liability
                                            to derange the plug or
                                            hydrant. This is the chief
                                            function of the casing C, although
                                            it likewise serves the
                                            purpose of protection to the
                                            water-pipe A.

The drawings of the original and of the reissue are also here [see next page] placed side by side:
The material difference between the descriptive parts of the two specifications is that, in the reissue, it is stated that the casing C is movable, and that sufficient space is left between the bead a upon the hydrant proper, and the upper terminus of the casing C, to permit of sufficient up-and-down play of the casing C to allow it to slide loosely up and down, to accommodate the upward and downward movement of the earth during the process of freezing and thawing, without any
*570 
liability to derange the plug or hydrant. The casing could not thus slide loosely up and down, unless sufficient space were left between the bead a and the upper terminus of the casing. No suggestion of such arrangement is found in the specification of the original patent, and the drawing of that patent shows no space between the upper terminus of the casing and *571 the bead or flange above it. This is new matter introduced into the specification of the reissue, contrary to the express inhibition of § 4916 of the Revised Statutes.
Claim 1 of the reissue is for an invention not indicated or suggested in the original patent, namely, the independent up-and-down motion of the casing. In addition to this, the drawing of the original patent shows a close contact between the top of the casing and the bead or flange above it, so as absolutely to forbid any such independent up-and-down motion of the casing as is covered by the first claim of the reissue, while the drawing, Figure 1, of the reissue, shows a sufficient space between the top of the casing and the bead or flange above it to admit of such independent up-and-down motion.
Issue having been joined, proofs were taken on both sides, and the Circuit Court entered a decree dismissing the bill, from which the plaintiffs have appealed. Its opinion accompanies the record, and is reported in 22 Fed. Rep. 292. It held that the reissued patent was invalid, as matter of law, upon a comparison of the original with the reissue. We concur in this view.
It is sought to sustain the validity of the reissue by attempting to show that the model filed in the Patent Office with the original application exhibited the invention covered by the first claim of the reissue. It is doubtful whether that fact is satisfactorily established. But, irrespective of this, the case falls directly within the recent decision of this court in Parker & Whipple Co. v. Yale Clock Co., 123 U.S. 87. It was held in that case, that what was suggested in the original specification, drawings, or patent office model is not to be considered as a part of the invention intended to have been covered by the original patent, unless it can be seen from a comparison of the two patents that the invention which the original patent was intended to cover embraced the things thus suggested or indicated in the original specification, drawings, or patent office model, and unless the original specification indicated that those things were embraced in the invention intended to have been secured by the original patent. (See, also, Hoskin v. Fisher, 125 U.S. 217.) In the present *572 case, it cannot be seen from a comparison of the two patents that the original specification indicated that what is covered by the first claim of the reissue was intended to have been secured by the original.
In the present case, also, the reissue was not applied for until nearly eight years after the original patent was granted, and the reissue was taken with the manifest intention of covering, by an enlarged claim, structures which in the meantime had gone into extensive public use, and which were not covered by any claim of the original patent.
Infringement is alleged only of claims 1 and 3 of the reissue. As to the casing C of the third claim, it cannot, any more than the casing C of the first claim, be held to cover a casing which has the independent up-and-down motion referred to. Such casing must be construed to be the casing exhibited in the drawing annexed to the original patent, that is, one in which the up-and-down play is restricted by the overlapping bead or flange. On any other construction, claim 3 is an unlawful expansion, in regard to the casing, of what is found in the original patent. In addition to this, if the casing of claim 3 is only a casing which has no end play, it is anticipated by what is shown in letters patent No. 19,206, granted to Race and Mathews, January 26, 1858, which patent was the subject of the decision of this court in Mathews v. Machine Co., 105 U.S. 54.
The decree of the Circuit Court is affirmed.
