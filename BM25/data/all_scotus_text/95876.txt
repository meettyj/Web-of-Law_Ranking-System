BARNETT.
No. 235.
Supreme Court of United States.

Argued with No. 236, ante, p. 471, and by the same counsel.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES:
This is the case of an enlisted man who makes a claim similar to the above, under Rev. Stat. ยง 1290, as amended. He was discharged on his own application, and the order of discharge stated that he was not entitled to travel pay. The foregoing reasoning also governs this case.
Judgment reversed.
