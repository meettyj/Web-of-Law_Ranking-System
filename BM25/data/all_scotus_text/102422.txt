      On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the State of Ohio. The motion for leave to proceed further herein in forma pauperis is denied for the reason that the Court, upon examination of the papers herein submitted, finds no ground upon which a writ of certiorari should be issued. The petition for writ of certiorari is therefore also denied.
