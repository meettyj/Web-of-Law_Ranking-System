                    Statement of STEVENS, J.  SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
            JUAN VELAZQUEZ v. ARIZONA   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME 
                  COURT OF ARIZONA 
              No. 07–8946. Decided April 21, 2008   
   The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
   Statement of JUSTICE STEVENS respecting the denial of the petition for certiorari.
   While I agree with the Court’s decision to deny certio- rari in this case, it is appropriate to emphasize, as I have in the past, see, e.g., Knight v. Florida, 528 U.S. 990 (1999) (opinion respecting denial of certiorari); Singleton v. Commissioner, 439 U.S. 940, 942 (1978) (same), that the denial of certiorari expresses no opinion on the merits of the underlying claim.  e>
