              Statement of STEVENS and KENNEDY, JJ.  SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
              LAKHDAR BOUMEDIENE ET AL. 06–1195                  v.   GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED  
               STATES, ET AL.   
   KHALED A. F. AL ODAH, NEXT FRIEND OF FAWZI  
    KHALID ABDULLAH FAHAD AL ODAH, ET AL.    06–1196                          v.
                   UNITED STATES ET AL.   ON PETITIONS FOR WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED 
    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF 
                  COLUMBIA CIRCUIT  
          Nos. 06–1195 and 06–1196. Decided April 2, 2007   
   The petitions for writs of certiorari are denied.
   Statement of JUSTICE STEVENS and JUSTICE KENNEDY respecting the denial of certiorari.
   Despite the obvious importance of the issues raised in these cases, we are persuaded that traditional rules gov erning our decision of constitutional questions, see Ash- wander v. TVA, 297 U.S. 288, 341 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring), and our practice of requiring the exhaustion of available remedies as a precondition to accepting juris diction over applications for the writ of habeas corpus, cf. Ex parte Hawk, 321 U.S. 114 (1944) (per curiam), make it appropriate to deny these petitions at this time. However, “[t]his Court has frequently recognized that the policy underlying the exhaustion-of-remedies doctrine does not require the exhaustion of inadequate remedies.” Marino v. Ragen, 332 U.S. 561, 570, n. 12 (1947) (Rutledge, J., concurring). If petitioners later seek to establish that the  2                   BOUMEDIENE v. BUSH 
             Statement of STEVENS and KENNEDY, JJ.  Government has unreasonably delayed proceedings under the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, Tit. X, 119 Stat. 2739, or some other and ongoing injury, alternative means exist for us to consider our jurisdiction over the allegations made by petitioners before the Court of Appeals. See 28 U. S. C. §§1651(a), 2241. Were the Government to take additional steps to prejudice the position of petitioners in seeking review in this Court, “courts of competent jurisdic tion,” including this Court, “should act promptly to ensure that the office and purposes of the writ of habeas corpus are not compromised.” Padilla v. Hanft, 547 U.S. 1062, 1064 (2006) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in denial of certio rari). And as always, denial of certiorari does not consti tute an expression of any opinion on the merits. See Rasul v. Bush, 542 U.S. 466, 480–481 (2004) (majority opinion of STEVENS, J.); id., at 487 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment).  e>
