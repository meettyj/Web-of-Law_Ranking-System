      2. Within the 12-mile circle (that is, within the circle the radius of which is 12 miles, and the center of which is the building used prior to 1881 as the courthouse at New Castle, Del., certain arcs of which are hereafter described and determined), the Delaware river and the subaqueous soil thereof up to mean low-water line on the easterly or New Jersey side is adjudged to belong to the state of Delaware, and the true boundary line between the states within said 12-mile circle is adjudged to be mean low-water mark on the easterly or New Jersey side of the Delaware river.
