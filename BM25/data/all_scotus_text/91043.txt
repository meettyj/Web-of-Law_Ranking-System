      It was decided at the last term in Ex parte Tom Tong, 108 U. S. [S. C. 2 SUP. CT. REP. 871,] that this court could not take jurisdiction of a certificate of division in opinion between the judges of a circuit court in proceedings under a writ of habeas corpus until final judgment has been rendered in accordance with the opinion of the presiding justice or judge. This is such a case, and it is consequently remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings according to law.
