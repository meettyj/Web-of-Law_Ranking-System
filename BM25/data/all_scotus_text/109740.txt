      4. The terms "Middle of the River" and "Middle of the Harbour," as used in the above-quoted Order, mean the middle of the main channel of navigation of the Piscataqua River and the middle of the main channel of navigation of Gosport Harbor.
    
    
      9
      5. The middle of the main channel of navigation of the Piscataqua River, commencing in the vicinity of Fort Point, New Hampshire, and Fishing Island, Maine, proceeding southward, is as indicated by the range lights located in the vicinity of Pepperrell Cove, Kittery Point, Maine, and it follows the range line as marked on the Coast and Geodetic Survey Chart 211, 8th Edition, Dec. 1, 1973.
    
    
      10
      6. The main channel of navigation of the Piscataqua River terminates at a point whose position is latitude 43x02'42.5" North and longitude 70x42'06" West.  Said point has a computed bearing of 194x44'47.47" true and a computed distance of 1,554.45 metres (1,700 yards) from the Whaleback Lighthouse, No. 19, USCG-158, whose position is latitude 43x03'31.213" North and longitude 70x41'48.515" West (reference National Geodetic Survey).
    
    
      11
      7. The middle of the main channel of navigation of Gosport Harbor passes through a point indicated by the bottom of the BW "IS" Bell Buoy symbol as shown on Coast and Geodetic Survey Chart 211, 8th Edition, Dec. 1, 1973.  The position of this point is latitude 42x58'51.6" North and longitude 70x37'17.5" West as scaled from the above-described chart.
    
    
      12
      8. The main channel of navigation of Gosport Harbor terminates at a point whose position is latitude 42x58'55" North and longitude 70x37'39.5" West.

      14
      10. The lateral marine boundary line between New Hampshire and Maine connecting the channel termination points described above is the arc of a great circle (appears as a straight line on a Mercator projection) whose computed length is 9,257.89 metres (10,124.53 yards).
    
    
      15
      11. The lateral marine boundary line between New Hampshire and Maine from the Piscataqua River channel termination point proceeds toward Gosport Harbor channel termination point on a computed bearing of 139x20'27.22" true.
    
    
      16
      12. The lateral marine boundary line between New Hampshire and Maine from the Gosport Harbor channel termination point proceeds toward Piscataqua River channel termination point on a computed bearing of 319x17'25.43" true.
