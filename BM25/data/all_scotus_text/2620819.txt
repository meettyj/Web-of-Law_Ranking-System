4 U.S. 410 (____)
4 Dall. 410
Guppy et al. 
versus 
Brown.
Supreme Court of United States.

*411 Ingersoll, and Tod, for the plaintiffs.
Franklin, and Dallas, for the defendant.
By the COURT:
The objection is fatal. The commissioners do not derive their authority from the parties, but from the Court; and as it is a special authority, it must be strictly pursued. The power given to four, cannot be well executed by three, commissioners.
The evidence over-ruled.
