# Web-of-Law_Ranking-System
This Project focuses on processing legal court decisions and is part of on-going research at New York University. This code is in development and is not ready for public release. Initially, we are using github as a version-control and development tool.

## How To Run
To generate one document for 'BM25' algorithm to rank, you need first run `$ python generate_corpus.py` in BM25 folder. It will iterate all documents given in corpus and then, create one including all text data. After that, you can run `$ python main.py` to print the ranking result of 'BM25'. Using command `nohup python main.py &> ./result/RESULT_10query_allScotus.txt &` to save it in result folder.
